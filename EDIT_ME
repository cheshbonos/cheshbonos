Dedication: Cheshbonos is dedicated to the memory of Rav Dov Zemmel z'l, a talmid muvak of R Chayim Pinchas Scheinberg, who taught dozens of talmidim to learn Gemara in an authentic and accurate way. This tool is inspired by the _derech halimud_ he imparted to his talmidim.


[Cheshbonos/Guide]

* Getting Started: This will be expanded to include a history of the Mishnah and Gemara for beginners.


[Dikduk]

* Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ:
Several of the [[verb forms beginning with מ]] are from Aramaic:
- The Aramaic [[{pa’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְזַמֵּן, _mezamen,_ “he is inviting.”)
- The Hebrew [[{pu’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְזוֹמָּן, _mezumen,_ “he is being invited.”)
- The Hebrew [[{hif’il active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מַבְדִּיל, _mavdil,_ “he is separating.”)
- The Hebrew [[{huf’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מוֹבְדָּל, _muvdal,_ “it is being separated.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispe’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִי(תְ)מְסֵיר, _mi(s’)m’seir,_ “he is being handed over.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispa’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִ(תְ)קַדַשׁ, _mi(s)kadash_ “he is being sanctified.”)
- The Hebrew [[{itaf’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִיתַּפְקַד, _mitafkad_ “he is being deposited.”)


* Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ:
Several of the [[verb forms beginning with מ]] are from Hebrew:
- The Hebrew [[{pa’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְקַדֵּישׁ, _mekadeish,_ “he is making holy.”)
- The Hebrew [[{pa’el passive participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְקַדַּשׁ, _mekadash,_ “it is being made holy.”)
- The Hebrew [[{af’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מַפְקֵיד, _mafkeid,_ “he is depositing.”)
- The Hebrew [[{af’el passive participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מַלְבַּשׁ, _malbash,_ “he is being dressed.”)
- The Hebrew [[{hispa’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִתְלַבֵּשׁ, _mislabeish,_ “he dressed himself.”)


* How to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic: This is what you need to know to identify a verb in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Every verb comes from a [[shoresh]].
- A shoresh gets put into a [[“binyan”]] which produces a verb, which might have several possible meanings. If you can figure out the shoresh and binyan, that will narrow down the action being spoken about to a few possibilities, but we still wont know who is doing the action, or when.
- Next we try to determine [[“tenses” of Hebrew and Aramaic|the tense of the verb]], like the [[future tense]] or [[past tense]].
- Next we try to determine the “person” of the verb, eg first-person (“I run”) or “second-person” (“you run”), etc.
- So, when we see a verb in the Gemara, we want to identify the shoresh, the binyan, the tense, and the person.


* Strong letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “strong” in that if they are part of a [[shoresh]] then they will appear in all verbs formed from that shoresh.
- Strong letters are those that are not [[weak letters]].


* Verb forms beginning with ה:
There are several verb forms in Hebrew and Aramaic that begin with a ה prefix:
- The [[{hifil past tense} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הִבְדִּיל, _hivdil,_ “he separated.”)
- The [[{hifil imperative} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הַבְדֵּל, _havdeil,_ “separate!”)


* Verb forms beginning with מ:
There are [[several {{Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ}}]], and [[several {{Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ}}]].


* Vowel shift for ח and ע: When ח or ע are after a vowel sound like “ei,” sometimes a second vowel sound “ah” is added.
- For example, the [[_pa’al_ active participle for regular shorushim]] has an “ei” vowel sound, eg כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, he is writing.)
- However, the [[pa’al active participle for shorushim ending with ח or ע]] has two vowel sounds, eg פּוֹתֵחַ (_posei-ach_, he is opening.)
- Some linguists bring this as [[evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters]].

Evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters:
Some linguists bring vowel changes for shorushim ending in ח or ע as evidence for a shift in their pronunciation:
- We generally pronounce ח like we do כ, and ע like we do א.
- However, some linguists point to the fact that “gutteral” letters like ח or ע receive an “extra” vowel sound (_po-say-ach_ as opposed to, e.g. _kos-eiv)_ as evidence that the original sounds of ח and ע were different from כ and א.
- The real sound for a ח or ע might have been so low in the throat, that the jaw would need to open fully to pronounce them, causing the vowel shift from “ei” to “ah.”
- This is as opposed to the כ or א letters which are similar to ח and ע but which are pronounced at the back of the mouth, without opening the throat, and can therefore accomidate an “ei” vowel, eg הוֹלֵךְ (_holeich_, [he] is walking), or בּוֹרֵא (_borei_, [he] is creating.)


* Weak letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “weak” in that it is not clear if they are part of a word’s [[shoresh]] or whether they are added as vowels or part of a conjugation. Sometimes, weak letters act as consonants, and are pronounced strongly.
- The weak letters are ‎א, ‎ע, ‎ה, ‎ח, ‎י, ‎ו, and ‎נ.
- Letters that are not weak are [[strong letters]].


[Dikduk/Aramaic]

* Aramaic definite article:
The Aramaic definite article is a grammatical entity in the Aramaic language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[definite article]], one of the two types of [[articles]].
- In Aramaic, the definite article is an א suffix after a noun, usually vowelized אָ, _au_.
- Sometimes Aramaic uses the א suffix in situations that we wouldn’t use the word “the” in English, for difficult to understand reasons.
- Hebrew also has a [[Hebrew {definite article}]], but it is a ה prefix, like הַמֶלֶךְ (_hamelech,_ “the king.”)


* Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Words like “running” which are called “participles” require a pronoun like “I” to clarify who is doing the action, eg “I am running.”
- In Aramaic, we can attach the pronoun to the end of the verb, for example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- (As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].)
- These are the Aramaic words that get added as suffixes:
| ‎אֲנָא ‎ <br><br> _anau_ <br><br><br> I | ‎אַתְּ‎ <br><br> _at_ <br><br><br> You [man or woman] |
| ‎אֲנַן‎ <br><br> _anan_ <br><br><br> We | ‎אַתּוּ/ן‎ <br><br> _atu/n_ <br><br><br> You [men or women] |


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim]

* Aramaic binyanim: There six binyanim in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Aramaic* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[Active]]  | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |
| [[Passive]] / [[Reflexive]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |
The binyanim of Aramaic mostly align with the [[Hebrew binyanim]].


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim/Af’el]

* Af’el: The “Af’el” (אַפְעֵל) is one of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- A verb in the _af’el_ often has a meaning of making someone else take on properties of the [[shoresh]].
- For example, the shoresh שמע means “hearing or understanding,” and the _af’el_ verb אַשְׁמַע means “to make someone else hear or understand,” ie to teach.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the _af’el_]].

- The _pe’al_ past tense has [[_Pe’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim|conjugations for regular shorushim]]. (Conjugations for [[irregular shorushim]] are not yet available.)
- The _pe’al_ past tense corresponds to the [[_pa’al_ past tense]] of Hebrew.


* _Pe’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim:
The [[_pe’al_ past tense]] follows these conjugations for [[regular shorushim]] like כתב:
|                | *Singular* |\<                          | *Plural* |\< |
| *First- <br> Person* | כְּתַבִית‎, כְּתַבִי <br><br> _ksavi, ksavis_ <br><br><br> I wrote | \<   | כְּתַבְנָא‎, כְּתַבְנַן‎, <br> כְּתַבַן‎, כְּתַבִינַן <br><br> _ksavnan, ksavnau, <br> ksavinan, ksavan_ <br><br><br> We wrote | \< |
| *Second-Person*    | כְּתַבְתְּ <br><br> _ksavt_ <br><br><br> You wrote | \< | כְּתַבְתּוּן‎, <br> כְּתַבִיתוּ <br><br> _ksavtun, <br> ksavisu_ <br><br><br> You [males] wrote  | כְּתַבְתִּין <br><br> _kesavtin_ <br><br><br> You [females] wrote |
| *Third-Person*     | כְּתַב <br><br> _kesav_ <br><br><br> He<span>&nbsp;</span>wrote | כְּתַבָה‎, כְּתַבָא,‎ כְּתַבַת‎ <br><br> _ksavas, ksavau_ <br><br><br> She wrote  | כְּתוּב‎, כְּתַבוּ <br><br> _ksavu, ksuv_ <br><br><br> They [males] wrote | כְּתַבָן‎, כְּתַבָה <br><br> _ksavau, ksavaun_ <br><br><br> They [females] wrote |
[^1]: Because Aramaic was a less-formal spoken language, it often has several versions of the same word.
[^2]: For any regular shoresh, you can replace the letters ‎כ, ‎ת, and ב above with the letters of your shoresh to produce the proper conjugations.
[^3]: Attempts to vowelize the Gemara are speculative. These conjugations are based on R Yitzchok Frank's _Grammar for Gemara_.


[Dikduk/Articles]

* Articles: Articles are a grammatical entity that exists in most languages.
- Articles are words like “the” or “a” that come before a noun.
- Articles clarify whether the thing being spoken about is known to the listener (“the dog” i.e. the [[definite article]]), or whether we are speaking in general (“a dog” i.e. the [[indefinite article]].)


* Definite Article: A definite article is a grammatical entity in most languages.
- A definite article is one of the [[two types of {{articles}}]].
- A definite article clarifies that the noun being spoken about is already known to the listener
- In English, the definite article is the word "the," as in "the cat," as opposed to "a cat," which is the [[indefinite article]].
- There is a [[Hebrew definite article]] and an [[Aramaic definite article]]


* Indefinite Article: An indefinite article is a grammatical entity in most languages.
- A definite article is one of the [[two types of {{articles}}]].
- A definite article clarifies that we are speaking about any entity within a category
- In English, the definite article is the word "a," as in "a cat," as opposed to "the cat," which would be the [[definite article]].
- There is a [[Hebrew definite article]] and an [[Aramaic definite article]]


[Dikduk/Binyan]

* Active: “Active” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Active verbs represent actions where [[the person being described is the one doing the action]], as opposed to [[{{passive}} verbs]].
- There are [[several {{active binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is the one doing the action: Active verbs represent actions where the person being described is the one doing the action, as opposed to [[passive]] verbs. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |

 the verb לִקְנוֹת means “to buy,” and because it is active, the one being described is the one who is buying, as opposed to describing the thing being bought.


* Active binyanim:
There are several [[active]] binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Actives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Pa’al_]]  | [[_Pi’el_]] | [[_Hif’il_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |


* Binyan: “Binyan” is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English.
- If you take a [[shoresh]], for example אכל, which represents “eating,” and put it into a certain “binyan,” you produce a verb, for example לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_, which means “to feed.”
- You can identify the binyan of a verb by its vowel sounds. Other verbs that rhyme with לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_ will have similar meanings, because they are from the same “binyan.”
- Every conjugated verb has one shoresh and one binyan.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the concept of binyan]].

Learn more about the concept of binyan:
Here is additional explanation of the concept of “binyan”:
- Binyanim of a shoresh are [[like different flavors of the shoresh meaning]].
- Every binyan is a combination of [[five basic types of action]].
- There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].
- There are also [[nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim]].

Like different flavors of the shoresh meaning: You can think of a binyan as being a “flavor” that gets mixed with the shoresh to produce different verbs. For example:
| *The shoresh* | *Can be put into a binyan called* | *Which has a “flavor” of* | *And produces the verb* |
| אכל <br> eating | [[_hif’il_]] | causing someone else to do something | eating + causing = <br> “to feed” |
| כתב <br> writing | [[_pi’el_]] | doing something more intensely | writing + intense = <br> “to engrave” |
| קנה <br> buying | [[_nif’al_]] | having something done to you | buying + <br> something done to you = <br> “to be purchased” |
In English [[we use alternative means to achieve the same effect]].

Five basic types of action: There are five “types” of action that get combined to produce different binyanim:
- [[Active]]: Someone doing something themselves
- [[Passive]]: Someone having something done to them
- [[Simple]]: Someone doing a very straight-forward version of an action
- [[Intensive]]: Someone doing an intense or repetitive version of an action
- [[Causative]]: Someone causing someone else do an action
All of the different [[Hebrew Binyanim|binyanim of Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic Binyanim|of Aramaic]] are different combinations of these five ideas. For example, the [[_hif’il_]] is “active,” and “causative.”

We use alternative means to achieve the same effect: In English, we do not use “binyan” to produce families of related verbs.
- Rather, in English you have one simple verb like “eat,” and then you add other words to form larger ideas like “he made someone eat,” or “he was eaten,” etc, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic those permutations are baked into the verb itself.
- Additionally, in English, words like “buy” and “sell” have no visual similarity, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, “to buy” (לִקְנוֹת) and “to sell” (לְהִיקָּנוֹת) would be “two binyans” of the same shoresh (קנה), and would share many of the same letters.

Nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim: Every verb has one binyan, and there are nouns and adjectives that come from a verb in a particular binyan.
- For example, from every _pi’el_ verb you can produce a _pi’el_ noun with the same meaning by using [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]].

A shoresh is put “into” a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל “to eat,” לְהַאֲכִיל “to feed,” or adjective אָכוּל “eaten.”


* Binyanim: There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].


* Causative: “Causative” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Causative verbs often describe [[an action that makes something else change]]. A binyan that is causative has verbs that are causative and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]]:

An action that makes something else change: Causative verbs often describe an action that makes someone or something else become a certain way. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Causative verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to make someone else eat (ie to feed) |
| חזר | to return | to make something return (ie to return something) |
| בוה | to come | to make something come (ie to bring something) |
| זכר | to remember | to make something be remembered (ie to mention) |

Several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] causative binyan is called the [[_hif’il_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] causative binyan is called the [[_huf’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” causative binyan is called the [[_af’el_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” causative binyan is called the [[_itaf’al_]]


* Intensive: “Intensive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Intensive verbs often have meanings that are [[intensive or repetitive]].
- A binyan that is intensive has verbs that are intensive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are [[several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Intensive or repetitive: Intensive verbs often have meanings that are more intensive or repetitive versions of their associated [[shoresh]], although sometimes the meaning is [[causative]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple Verb* | *Intensive Verb* |
|-|-|-|
| שבר | to break | to shatter |
| ישב | to sit | to create a settlement |
| כתב | to write | to engrave |
Ultimately these are just rules of thumb, and you can never be sure exactly what an intensive verb will mean just by looking at the meaning of its shoresh generally.

Several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s [[active]] intensive binyan is the [[_pi’el_]]
- Hebrew’s [[passive]] intensive binyan is the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s active intensive binyan is the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s passive intensive [[_ispa’al_]]


* Passive: “Passive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Passive verbs usually represent actions where [[the person being described is having an action done to them]], as opposed to [[{{active}} verbs]]
- A binyan that is passive has verbs that are passive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are several [[{{passive binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is having an action done to them: Passive verbs represent actions where the thing being described is having an action done to them, as opposed to verbs that are [[active]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |
This is a rule of thumb, although sometimes passive verbs have [[{{reflexive}} meanings]].


* Passive binyanim:
There are several [[passive]] binyanim in Hebrew and in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Passives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Nif’al_]]  | [[_Pu’al_]] | [[_Huf’al_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |


* Reflexive: “Reflexive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Reflexive verbs often refer to [[circular]] or [[transformative actions]].
- A binyan that is reflexive has verbs that are reflexive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are [[several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Circular: Reflexive verbs often describe an action where the doer does something to themselves, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| לבש | to dress | to dress oneself |
| בדד | to seperate | to go into isolation |
| בלל | to mix | to assimilate |
| גדר | to fence | to limit oneself to something |
 the shoresh לבש corresponds to the concept of clothing, and the causative verb from that shoresh is לְהִתְלַבֵּשׁ, which means “to dress oneself.”

Transformative actions: Reflexive verbs can also refer to situations where an entity undergoes a transformation, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| חדש | to be new | to revitalize |
| זקן | to be old | to grow old |
| חרש | to be deaf | to become deaf |

Several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s reflexive binyan is called the [[_hispa’el_]]
- Aramaic’s [[passive]] binyanim, [[_ispe’el_]], [[ispa’al]], and [[itaf’al]], can also be reflexive.
- In general [[{{passive}} verbs]] can also sometimes have reflexive meanings.


* Simple: “Simple” (also known as _kal)_ is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Simple verbs usually have [[meanings that are similar to their shoresh]]. A binyan that is simple has verbs that are simple and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Meanings that are similar to their shoresh: Simple verbs have meanings that are very similar to their associated [[shoresh]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *Simple verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | eating | to eat |
| הלח | walking | to walk |
| אמר | speech | to say |
| ישב | sitting | to sit |

 the shoresh אכל represents the idea of eating, whereas the simple verb of that shoresh is לֶאֱכוֹל, which means “to eat.”

Several simple binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] simple binyan is called the [[_pa’al_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] simple binyan is called the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” simple binyan is called the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” simple binyan is called the [[_ispe’el_]]


* Stative verbs: Stative verbs are a category of verb that sometimes have special conjugations in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- A stative verb usually describe static qualities as opposed to actions.
| *Example stative verb* | *Meaning* |
| כּבֵד | to be heavy |
| חָכַם | to be wise |
| זָקֵן | to be old |
- Stative verbs are found in the [[simple]] binyanim, [[_pa’al_]] for Hebrew and [[_pe’al_]] for Aramaic.

* The prefix ל: There is a ל prefix in Hebrew and Aramaic. It generally means “to.” More information will be added in future.


[Dikduk/Forms]

* Active Participle: The active participle, usually just called “the participle” (and sometimes called the present participle or _lashon po’el)_ is one of the [["tenses" of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- In English, an example of the active participle is the word “running.”
- The active participle can be used to make sentences like “I am running,” or “I was running.”
- Students interested in grammar can read [[additional information about the active participle]].

Additional information about the active participle:
This is additional information about the active participle:
- The active participle describes an ongoing action, as opposed to [[the {{passive participle}}]].
- Participles can only be used when combined with other words in special combinations called [[participle {constructions}]].
- The active participle has [[{forms } of the active participle {in Hebrew}]] and [[{forms } of the active participle {in Aramaic}]].


* Forms of the active participle in Aramaic:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| Binyan        | Type | Example | Transliteration |
|---------------|------|---------|----------------|
| [[_Pe’al_]] | [[simple]], [[active]] | כָּתֵיב | _kauseiv_ |
| [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | מִתְכְּתִב | _miskesiv_ |
| [[_Pa’el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְקַדֵּיש | _mekad’deish_ |
| [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְתְקַדַש | _miskadash_ |
| [[_Af’el_]] | [[causative]], [[active]] | מַכְתִּיב | _machtiv_ |
| [[_Itaf’al_]] | [[causative]] [[passive]], or [[reflexive]] | מִתַּפְקַד | _mitafkad_ |

For gender and number:
The participle is conjugated for gender and number:
| Person | Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Masculine singular | כּוֹתֵב | _koseiv_ | one man writing |
| Feminine singular | כּוֹתֶבֶת | _koseves_ | one woman writing |
| Masculine plural | כּוֹתְבִים | _kosvim_ | multiple men writing |
| Feminine plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosvos_ | multiple women writing |
This is unlike the [[past tense]] or [[future tense]] that have [[separate forms for person]]. This is because the participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is [[like an adjective]].

Separate forms for person: Tenses other than the participle have conjugations for every person, eg the [[_pa’al_]] [[past tense]]:
| *Person* | *Hebrew* | *Transliteration* | *Meaning* |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| First singular | כָּתַבְתִּי | _kosavti_ | I wrote |
| First-person plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosavnu_ | We wrote |
| Second singular masculine | כָּתַבְתָּ | _kosavto_ | You (man) wrote |
| Second singular feminine | כָּתַבְתְּ | _kosavt_ | You (woman) wrote |
| Second plural masculine | כְּתַבְתֶּם | _ksavtem_ | You (men) wrote |
| Second plural feminine | כְּתַבְתֶּן | _ksavten_ | You (women) wrote |
| Third plural masculine | כָּתַב | _kosav_ | He wrote |
| Third plural feminine | כָּתְבָה | _kosvo_ | She wrote |
| They/those | כָּתְבוּ | _kosvu_ | They wrote |

Like an adjective: The participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is more like an adjective than a verb, with “he is running” having the same grammatical form as “he is tall.” (This example uses the participle of the [[_{{pa’al}} binyan_]]. [[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)


* Forms of the active participle in Hebrew:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Hebrew binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)

* Future Tense: The future tense is one of the [["tenses" of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- The future tense generally describes a future action.
- However, the future tense has [[several alternative uses]].

Several alternative uses: The future tense generally describes a future action, however:
- The future tense [[can describe a command]].
- The future tense [[can describe a moral suggestion]].
- The future tense [[can describe a prayer]].

Can describe a command: The future tense can describe a command.
- For example, תִּכְתֹּב (_tichtov_, literally “you will write,”) can mean “you _shall_ write.”
- The _Torah_ generally expresses positive commandments using the [[{{imperative}} form]], but negative commandments are often expressed using the future tense, such as לֹא תִּרְצָח, “thou shalt not kill.”

Can describe a prayer:
The future tense can describe a prayer.
- For example, השם יְרַחֵם, _Hashem yeracheim_ (literally “Hashem will be compassionate”) can mean “I pray Hashem will be compassionate.”
- It may be that this usage is just an example of the former category of “moral suggestion,” i.e. the speaker may literally be saying “Hashem _should be_ compassionate,” by which he means “I hope that Hashem is compassionate.”

Can describe a moral suggestion:
The future tense can describe a moral suggestion.
- For example, תַּעֲזֹר, _ta’azoir_ (lit. “you will help”) can mean “you should help.”


* Imperative: The imperative, also known as “the command form,” is one of the [["tenses" of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an imperative in English is “run!”
- The imperative describes an action that the speaker is telling the listener to do.


* Infinitive: The infinitive is one of the [["tenses" of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an infinitive in English is “to run.”
- An infinitive describes an action without specifying who is doing it.


* Participle: The participle is a category of verb that appears in most languages.
- An example of a word in the participle is “burning” or “running.”
- Hebrew and Aramaic have two participle forms, [[the {{“active” participle}} form]], and [[the {{“passive” participle}} form]].
- Unlike words in the past or future tense which can be used alone as full sentences, participle words only form meaningful sentences when combined with other words in one of several “[[{{participle constructions}}]].”


* Participle constructions: Participle constructions are when a word in [[the {{participle}}]] is combined with other words in special combinations to express larger ideas.
- The most common “construction” is when [[a participle is combined with a noun to produce a sentence in the {{present tense}}]].
- There are participle constructions [[for describing actions in various time periods]].
- Words in the participle [[can be used as nouns]] or [[can be used as adjectives]].
- All of these rules apply to both the [[active participle]] and the [[passive participle]].

For describing actions in various time periods:
A word in the [[participle]] can be combined with other words to describe actions in different time periods.
- A word in the participle by itself technically [[has no time]].
- However, it can be used [[in the past]] or [[in the future]] using different constructions.

Has no time: A word in the participle of Hebrew or Aramaic does not alone tell us what time the action happened. This is like the English word “running,” which only describes an action, not when it happened. We require the context of the sentence to determine the time of the action.

In the past: The participle can be used in the past tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא הָיָה כּוֹתֵב (_hu haya koisev_) meaning “he used to write” or “he used to be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he wrote,” i.e. a one-time past event instead of an ongoing past event, you would just use the regular [[past tense]], and not the “past-tense construction” of the participle.

In the future: The participle can be used in the future tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא יִהְיֶה כּוֹתֵב (_hu yiyeh koisev_), meaning “he will be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he will write,” i.e. a one-time future event, you would just use the regular [[future tense]] and not the “future-tense construction” of the participle.

Can be used as nouns: The participle can be used as a noun in two ways:
- A participle [[can describe someone doing an action]].
- A participle [[can describe an instance of an action]].

Can describe someone doing an action:
The participle can represent someone doing a given action. For example:
| *General* | *Specific* |
| *רָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *a runner* needs shoes | *הַרָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ha’ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *the runner* needs shoes |
Here, we see the Hebrew word “running” can also mean “a person who is running,” and that adding a ה means “the person who is running,” a form found often in the Mishnah.

Can describe an instance of an action:
The participle can represent an instance of an action, (although this may be very uncommon.) For example:
|‎ *כּוֹתֵב* שֶׁלוֹ תַּמִיד <br><br> _*kosev* shelo tamid_ <br><br><br> his *writing* is constant | *זוֹעֵק* שֶׁלוֹ הַרְבֵּה <br><br> _*zo’eik* shelo harbe_ <br><br><br> his *yelling* is numerous |
Here, we see that the Hebrew word “writing” can be used as a noun, meaning “a particular instance of the act of writing.”

Can be used as adjectives: A participle can be used as an adjective, eg:
| Hebrew  | שִׁמְעוׄן *יָשׁוּב* |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _Shimeon *yashuv*_ |
| English | Shimeon is *seated* |
- Really, all participles are essentially adjectives, which is why they only have [[_Pa’al_ Active Participle for Regular Shorushim|four conjugations for gender and number]] as opposed to [[_Pa’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim|other tenses that have conjugations for different people]].
- I.e., in Hebrew and Aramaic, the words “tall” and “running” in the sentences “I am tall” and “I am running” are both the same type of word.


* Passive Participle: The passive participle (sometimes called the “passive participle,” or _lashon pa’ul_ or _pa’il)_ is a special type of word in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- In English, an example of a “passive” participle is the word “written,” or the word “burnt.”
- A passive participle represents the result of an action (eg “burnt”) as opposed to an ongoing action (eg “burning.”)
- Students interested in grammar can read [[additional information about the passive participle]].

Additional information about the passive participle:
Here is additional information about the passive participle:
- Passive participles are adjectives that are formed from verbs, for example “burnt” comes from the verb “to burn.”
- The passive participle in Hebrew looks like כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and in Aramaic like כְּתִיב (_kasiv)_.
- In Hebrew the passive participle only exists in [[the {{_pa’al_}} binyan]], i.e. [[the {{pa'al passive participle}}]].
- In Aramaic, there are passive participles in all of the active binyanim, i.e. the [[pe’al passive participle]], the [[pa’el passive participle]], and the [[af’el passive participle]].
- There are [[differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim]].
- Like [[the {{active participle}}]], the passive participle only has meaning in [[one of several {{“participle constructions”}}]].

Differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim:
Many students confuse the passive participle of active binyanim like [[_pa’al_]] and [[the {{active participle}}]] of [[passive binyanim]]:
- For example, what is the difference between the [[{|active} _pa’al_ {|binyan’s} passive participle]], כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and the [[{|passive} _nif’al_ {|binyan’s} active participle]], נִכְתָּב _nichtav?_
- The [[simple]] [[passive]] binyanim i.e. [[the Hebrew {{_nif’al_}}]] and [[the Aramaic {{_ispe’el_}}]] represent an ongoing action being done to the subject e.g. “it is _being_ written” or “it is _regularly_ written upon.”
- The passive participle כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, by contrast, would mean “it is written,” without a connection to an ongoing action.


* Past tense: The past tense is one of the [["tenses" of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Present tense: The present tense in Hebrew and Aramaic is formed by combining a [[participle]] with a pronoun in a special [[{“participle construction”}s]]:
- The present tense is produced by taking a pronoun like הוּא (_hu_, “he”) followed by a participle like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) producing a sentence, “he is writing.”
- There is no word equivalent to “is” in Hebrew and Aramaic, so we just say “he writing” and the “is” is implied by context.
- Even though the [[active participle]] is sometimes called the “present tense” (or לְשׁוֹן הוֹוֶה _lashon hoveh)_, an active participle by itself like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) is not necessarily in the present tense, and can be used in the past or future, as in “he was writing.”
- [[The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle]].

The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle: The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” construction corresponds to multiple English verb forms:
- In English, you can say “he is writing” (English participle) or “he writes” (English present tense.)
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, both of these forms would be expressed with the same participle construction i.e. הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv_.)
- Therefore, when we see a sentence like הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv)_, we can’t be sure whether it means “he is writing” or “he writes.”
- As English has many more words than Hebrew and Aramaic, it is quite common for multiple words in English to be the same word in Hebrew or Aramaic, producing ambiguities when translating from Hebrew or Aramaic back to English.


* “Tenses” of Hebrew and Aramaic: There are several verb forms and tenses in Hebrew and Aramaic:
| [[Past Tense]] | [[Future Tense]] | [[{{Active Participle}}]] |
| [[Imperative]] | [[Infinitive]] | [[Passive Participle]] |


[Dikduk/Hebrew]

* Hebrew definite article: The Hebrew definite article is a grammatical entity in the Hebrew language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[definite article]], one of the two types of [[articles]].
- In Hebrew, the definite article is a ה prefix before a noun, usually vowelized הַ, _ha_.
- Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the prefix ב]] or [[the prefix ל]] and becomes a בַ or לַ.
- Aramaic also has a [[Aramaic {definite article}]], but it is an א suffix, like עָלְמָא (_alma,_ “the world”)


[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim]

* Hebrew binyanim: There are seven binyanim in Hebrew. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)

[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim/Pu’al/Tenses/Infinitive]

* _Pu’al_ Infinitive: The _pu’al_ binyan shares [[_Hif’il_ Infinitive|an infinitive form with the _hif’il_ binyan]].
- This is because _hufal_ and _hif’il_ verbs are usually the same action, just differing as to whether the action is being done to someone else, or to oneself, and so they would be the same in the [[infinitive]], which isn’t conjugated to reflect who is doing the action.


[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim/Pu’al/Tenses/Past]

* _Pu’al_ Past Tense: The _pu’al binyan has a past tense.
- The _pu’al_ past tense has [[_Pu’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim|conjugations for regular shorushim]]. (Conjugations for [[irregular shorushim]] are not yet available.)
- The _pu’al_ past tense corresponds to the [_ispa’al_ past tense] of Aramaic.


* _Pu’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim:
The [[_pu’al_ past tense]] follows these conjugations for [[regular shorushim]] like זמן:

[Dikduk/Nouns]

* Hebrew noun patterns: Hebrew has several noun patterns, which are letter and vowel templates that accept shorushim to produce nouns. Nouns formed from a certain pattern often have a similar meaning relative to the shoresh. Noun patterns [[have a naming convention]]. These are some of the noun patterns in Hebrew:
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pa’al_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pi’el_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hif’il_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hispa’el_ verbs]]

Have a naming convention: Noun patterns are named by putting the shoresh קטל into the given pattern, the same way that binyan names are formed by putting the shoresh פעל into the third-person masculine past-tense form of that binyan.


* Noun Patterns: There are [[Hebrew noun patterns]] and Aramaic noun patterns.


* Noun patterns that come from _Hif’il_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hif’il_]] verbs include:
- [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _taktil_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Hispa’el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hispa’el_]] verbs include:
- [[The _hiskattlut_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pa’al_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pa’al_]] verbs include:
- [[the _ktila_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pi’el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pi’el_]] verbs include:
- [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]]


* Relationship between nouns in the _hektel_ noun pattern and the _haktala_ noun pattern:
There is a standard difference between nouns in [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]] and [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]:
| *_Shoresh_* | *_Hif’il_ verb* | *_Hektel_ noun* | *_Haktala_ noun* |
|-|-|-|-|
| בדל <br> seperation | הִבְדִיל <br><br> _hivdil_ <br><br><br> he seperated | הֶבְדֵּל <br><br> _hevdel_ <br><br><br> a difference / seperation | הַבְדָּלָה <br><br> _havdalah_ <br><br><br> an act of seperation |
| קדש <br> holiness | הִקְדִּישׁ <br><br> _hikdish_ <br><br><br> he donated to the temple | הֶקְדֵּשׁ <br><br> _hekdesh_ <br><br><br> property of the temple |  הַקְדָּשָׁה <br><br> _hakdasha_ <br><br><br> an act of donation <br> to the temple |
| קשר <br> connection | הִקְשִׁיר <br><br> _hikshir_ <br><br><br> he connected | הֶקְשֵׁר <br><br> _heksher_ <br><br><br> a connection | הַקְשָׁרָה <br><br> _hakshara_ <br><br><br> an act of connecting |
As you can see, the _hif’il_ verb represents an action, the _haktala_ noun represents an instance of that action, and the _hektel_ noun will represent the _result_ of that action. Not every _hif’il_ verb however will have both a _hektel_ and a _haktala_ form. For a full list of _hektel-haktala_ word pairs, see [Klein on _havdalah_](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B8%D7%94.1).

[Dikduk/Shoresh]

* Four-letter shorushim: While most shorushim have three letters, sometimes we see shorushim that seem to have four distinct letters.
- For example: שבעד, meaning “subjugation,” or טלטל meaning “movement.”
- These four-letter shorushim [[can only have verb forms in certain binyanim]].
- Four letter shorushim are often special forms of normal shorushim, like the [[_shaf’el_]] and the [[_pilpul_]] forms, although [[some seem to have intrinsic meanings]].

Can only have verb forms in certain binyanim:
Four-letter shorushim can only have verb forms in [[{{binyan}}im]] with a doubled middle letter, like the [[_pi’el_]].
- This is because the doubled letter creates room for the four consonant sounds of the shoresh:
| *Shoresh* | *[[_Pi’el_]] example* | *Notes*|
| דבר <br> speech | מְדַ*בֵּ*ר <br><br> _meda*b*’*b*er_ <br><br><br> he is saying | - This is a regular three-letter shoresh. <br> - The middle בּ (“b”) is said twice <br> - I.e. both “middle slots” are used for בּ |
| שׁחרר <br> liberation | מְשַׁ*חְרֵ*ר <br><br> _mesha*ch*’*r*eir_ <br><br><br> he is liberating | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ח (“ch”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ר (“r”)|
| טלטל <br> movement | מְטַ*לְטֵ*ל <br><br> _meta*l’t*el_ <br><br><br> he is moving | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ל (“l”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ט (“t”) |
- A verb form without a doubled middle letter, like כּוֹתֵב (_kosev_, “writing”), wouldn’t have room to accomidate the four consonants of a four-letter shoresh. (For advanced students, כּוֹתֵב is an example of a form called the [[_pa’al_ active participle]].)

Some seem to have intrinsic meanings: Some four letter shorushim seem to be intrinsically meaningful and are not related to other shorushim. For example:
- פרנס, “livelihood,” used in verbs like לְפַרְנֵס _lefarneis_ “to support financially.”
- קטרג, “accusation,” used in verbs like לְקַטְרֵג _lekatreig_, “to accuse”


* Irregular shorushim: An irregular shoresh, as opposed to a [[regular shor{ushim|esh}]], is a [[shoresh]] that has special letters that affect the vowelization of verbs produced from it. Here are some examples of irregular shorushim and their irregular verb conjugations:
| *Shoresh* | *Irregularity* | *Expected <br> Conjugation* | * Real <br> Conjugation* | *Comment* |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ישב | י in first position | מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_ | מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ | י changes to וֹ |
| נפל | נ in the first position | מַנְפִּיל (_manpil)_ | מַפִּיל (_map’pil)_ | נ drops, and the פ is doubled |
| בנה | ה in the last position | בָּנַהְתִּי  (_baunah’ti)_ | בָּנִיתִי (_bauniti)_ | the consonant ה becomes an יִ vowel, like “bee” |
There is a [[special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim]].

Special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim: We use the traditional [[shoresh letter numbering convention]] to produce an [[irregular shoresh naming convention]].

Shoresh letter numbering convention:
In Hebrew grammar, the shoresh פעל is used as a “standard” shoresh, and so sometimes the letters of פעל are used as names for the three shoresh positions:
| פ | ע | ל |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 For example, instead of saying “the first letter of the shoresh נפל,” you might say “the פ of the shoresh נפל.”

Irregular shoresh naming convention:
Because we use the letters פעל as names for the positions in a shoresh, if we want to say “the category of shorushim that have a י in the first position,” the name would be “י״פ verbs” (_yud-pay verbs_.)

A common example is a shoresh that has a י in the first position, such as ישב, where the י will often becomes a ו in verb forms that have prefixes, for example having מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ instead of the more typical מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_, which might be harder to pronounce.


* Pilpul: The _pilpul_ is a form where a weak shoresh with only two strong letters (eg טול) or a shoresh with a repeated second letter (eg לחח) has the first and last letters doubled to produce a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| טול | to move | טלטל | to teeter about |
| לחח | to be moist | לחלח | to moisten |
| בלל | to mix | בלבל | to confuse |
| משׁשׁ | to touch | משׁמשׁ | to examine physically |
The meaning of the _pilpul_ form is often a more repetitive version of the meaning of the two-letter form. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _pilpul_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Regular shorushim: A regular [[shoresh]] is a shoresh where the vowels and spelling of verbs that are produced from that shoresh follow the normal patterns for each verb form. This is as opposed to [[irregular shorushim]].


* Shaf’el: The _shaf’el_ form is a special type of [[four-letter shor{ushim|esh}]].
- It is produced by taking a shoresh like עבד and adding a ש to the front to produce a new shoresh like שעבד.
- A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf’el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]
- A shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf’el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Notes* |
| עבד <br> work | שעבד <br> subjugate <br> (to make someone else work) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| זרע <br> seeding | שזרע <br> reseeding (causing to become seeded) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| נוע <br> moving | שנע <br> transporting (causing to move) | This is a “weak” shoresh with only two strong letters, and it becomes a three letter shoresh |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf’el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Shoresh: Shoresh is a grammatical entity in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- An example of a shoresh is “א-כ-ל,” which represents the idea of “eating.”
- A shoresh is used to produce many related words, like אוֹכֶל, which means “food,” or אֲכִילָה, which means “the act of eating.”
- The shoresh is just a series of letters and is not itself a word, and has no vowels or pronunciation.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the concept of shoresh]].

Learn more about the concept of shoresh:
This is additional information on the concept of shoresh:
- A shoresh is a series of letters that represents a wide range of meaning, <br> like אכל (eating) שלח (sending) or ראה (sight)
- The word “shoresh” [[means root]] because shorushim are [[used to produce words]].
- Shorushim [[generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters]].
- There are [[regular shorushim]] and [[irregular shorushim]].

Means root:
The word shoresh can mean “root” or “source.”
- In this context, it means “root” in the sense that a words like “memory” and “memorize” come from the same linguistic root “mem.”

Generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters:
Shorushim generally have three letters. However:
- Some shorushim, [[appear to have two letters]].
- Some shorushim have [[Four-letter shorushim|have four letters]].

Appear to have two letters: Sometimes, we find words that only appear to have two recognizable letters, like מֵת, (_meis_, “he is dying.”)
- Some consider the word מֵת to come from a two-letter shoresh “מת”
- Some consider מֵת to come from a shoresh “מות,” whose “weak middle letter” gets hidden in certain conjugations. (Examples of “weak” letters are י,‎ ו and ה.)
- Either way, it is just a disagreement about what to call things, not over the spelling of any actual word.
- This site generally uses three letter shorushim like “מות” to keep things consistent, but either system is correct.

Corollaries in English: In English, you often have a linguistic root like “mem” which is used to produce a series of related words like “memory,” “memorize,” or “memorable.” Shorushim are a similar concept, except they are a bit more formal than in English, because there are fixed rules for how many letters they can be, and how they get turned into words.

Used to produce words: A shoresh is called a “root” because many words derive from one shoresh.
- A shoresh has a general meaning is used to generate many words with more specific meanings.
- For example, the shoresh אכל “eating” can be plugged into a particular verb pattern to generate the verb לְהַאֲכִיל, _leha’achil_, “to feed.”
- (For advanced readers, these patterns are called [[{{binyan}}im]], and לְהַאֲכִיל comes from the [[{{“hif’il”}} binyan]].)

Debate over the exact definition of a shoresh: Often we see words that only seem to have two root letters, like מת, and there is a debate over whether to think of these as being a special type of “two letter” shoresh, or whether to think of them as being a three-letter shoresh like מות that loses the middle letter in certain conjugations, but this dispute has no practical ramifications because everyone agrees on the spelling of the words that come from two-letter shorushim.

* First clause of the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
In order to learn the first clause of the Mishnah, we'll need to learn:
- Required Context
- Vocabulary
- Literal Translation

- How do you know where the first clause ends? How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? By reading the Mishnah, we should notices some similar-looking words being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Haaras
=============================
- Mishna
  - Rosh and Rambam?
  - How mishnayos are written - what would be the implication of each permutation, bedieved, lechatchila, etc
- Gemara’s Kasha:
  - three meanings of specificity
  - which mahalach is the gemara taking in its question
  - what is the makor for this?
  - How would you learn “haish mekadesh bshlucho”?
  - Where do we see the Gemara thinks shlichus is the bigger chiddush?
  - “also” “even” “for example”
- First answer
  - where does halacha come from / what entitles him to say this answer?
  - reason for shver mishnas
  - what is the amoritic story for?
  - What mitzvah is kiddushin? machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah, the fact that R Yosef says mitzvah ie where do we find a raya to the rambam and how does the Rosh handle it? (Maybe ask “what mitzvah is it” and introduce Rosh and Rambam here.)
  - Rosh baked matzas
  - What entitles R Yosef to say he knows what Rebbe meant?
  - Are Amoriam saying mesoras or theories?
  - What about the Mishnah makes it a proof for R Yosef’s halacha?
  - who is R Yosef? Why do we listen to them?
- Amoriam
  - Who is saying this?
  - Question of what they are proving
  - line up with shitas of machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah
  - shaarei tzion inside - what entitles him to say this chiddush?
- Second answer
  - stira to mishna
  - mialas and chisronos of both answers
  - not the same distinctions & who says that is the ookimpta and why are stam cases presumed stam
  - what is an ika damri, pnei yoshua: does the first answer not know about the second answer?
  - What does the nami mean? - put in by the compiler, or spectrum of assur/mitzvah eg second Tosofos
  -- R Zemmel holds that the nami is like the pnei yoshua, that l'mafrea we know both?
  - Isn’t he an oness?
  - Clarify that it isn’t RYAR’s halacha, we are presuming the Tana would know you have to see the woman first etc.
  - Who is R Yehuda amar Rav? Why do we listen to them?
- Ki itmar DRav Yosef:
  - Why didn’t the gemara stop there?
  - difference between intro of R Yosef and intro of R Yehuda amar Rav, R Yosef needs a total proof, why not say “one and one”?
  - Why does R Yosef get knocked off?
  - Why didn’t we have to move R Yehuda amar Rav?
  - Is this editing a memra of R Yosef, or was there never any memra?
  - Why take the drastic step of editing R Yosef when we can make a machlochus?
  - Why not say R Yosef holds RYAR’s source is another mishna? BC there’s no reason to think every chiddush of the mishnah is unique etc.
  - Why not just make it a machlochus / standard ika damri where there are multiple conflicting girsas?
  - Maybe we are moving R Yosef to explain the bah? But we don’t see this in the shakla v’taria.
  - Why doesn’t RYAR need a source for his halacha?
  - Why the Gemara concludes R Yosef must be moved
    1. R Yosef isn’t using a lashon of machlochus, he seems to be speaking as if he is the only game in town
    2. R Yosef agrees to RYAR’s halacha in theory
    3. RYAR’s halacha would objectively fit the “bo” and so can’t be rejected out of hand as a possibility
    4. RY is definitely speaking about our mishna
    Thus, there is a stira in R Yosef
  - How can you call what she’s doing a mitzvah?
    - vies tois a mesaye
    - But if a mesaye is called a mitzvah, why isn’t a mesaye called an aviera such that the ki itmar answer doesn’t work?
- Aval
  - set up Rashi
  - chazon ish emuna bitachon

[Gemara/Kiddushin/Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh/Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy/Pass 1/Sentence 01]

* First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
In order to learn the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
| [[Prepare to read <br> the first clause]] | [[Read the <br> first clause]] | [[Understand the <br> first clause]] |

Prepare to read the first clause:
There are various things you should know before trying to read the first clause.
- The first clause has [[required background knowledge]].
- You should [[try to predict what you think the halacha will be]].

Required background knowledge:
There is required background knowledge to understand the first clause.
- You'll need to know what _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are.
- You'll need to know what _shlichus_ is.

Try to predict what you think the halacha will be:
The first clause of the Mishnah is speaking about whether a man is allowed to create a binding engagement with a woman via a messenger. Do you think this should be possible? Why or why not?

Read the first clause:
In order to read the first clause of the Mishnah “האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו”:
- First, we'll [[identify where the sentence ends]].
- Then, we’ll translate the individual words:
< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]
- Then, we’ll put together a [[literal translation of the full sentence]]
- We’ll [[identify ambiguities]] and clarify the meaning of the text

Identify where the sentence ends:
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? Even if we don't know the meaning of the words, we should be able to notice some similar-looking patterns being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

האיש:
To understand the word “האיש”:
- We'll give a [[general translation of האיש]]
- We'll give a [[contextual translation of האיש]]
- For advanced students, we'll give a [[grammatical explanation of האיש]]
- For advanced students we'll explain [[how you could figure the meaning of האיש out yourself]]

General translation of האיש: In general the word “האיש” means “the man.”

Contextual translation of האיש: In this context, it means “a man” because we’re not speaking about any one man in particular. Sometimes the Mishnah will use the word “the” slightly differently than we would in English.

Grammatical explanation of האיש:
We can giev a grammatical explanation of האיש:
- האיש is the [[{{Hebrew definite article}} “ה”]] before the noun “איש”.

How you could figure the meaning of האיש out yourself:
Here’s how you could figure out the meaning of האיש yourself:
- First, let's remember that we're reading a Mishnah and so the language is going to be Hebrew and not Aramaic.
- Next, we should see if any of the letters are potentially prefixes or suffixes rather than being part of the underlying word.
- ה is sometimes a prefix, but ש is never a suffix, so we can conclude that either “האיש” is one big word, or the ה is a prefix, and the real word is איש.
- (It could also be that ה is a prefix and א is another prefix after that, but א is only a prefix in the Hebrew future tense first person (e.g. “I will run”), and there’s no situation in Hebrew where you can have a ה prefix followed by a future tense verb.)
- Thus, we can look up the word “האיש” in the dictionary, see that it doesn’t exist, and then try “איש,” and we would see that it does exist and is a noun meaning “man.”
- Once we know איש is a noun, the ה prefix can't be any of the [[verb forms beginning with ה|verb-related ה prefixes]], and so by process of elimination we know it is the [[Hebrew definite article]].

מקדש:
To understand the word “מקדש”:
- We’ll give a [[general translation of מקדש]]
- We’ll give a [[contextual translation of מקדש]]
- For more advanced students, we’ll give a [[grammatical explanation of מקדש]]
- For advanced students we’ll explain [[how you could figure the meaning of מקדש out yourself]]

General translation of מקדש:
To translate the word מקדש in general, first we should note that it is an ongoing “ing” verb like “running,” and it refers to someone who is making holiness in some way. For example:
- Hashem is _mekadesh es hashabos_, which means Hashem makes the Sabbath holy by designating it as special.
- When we say _kiddush_ before a holiday meal, this is referred to as “being _mekadesh_.”
- When a man wants to marry a woman, he must first create the “binding engagement” stage called _kiddushin_, and doing so is refered to as the man “being _mekadesh_” a woman.
The word מקדש is also in the “masculine singular,” so we are speaking about one man doing the action. So, מקדש means some man or masculine entity is doing one of the previously mentioned actions in an ongoing way.

Contextual translation of מקדש:
We can give a contextual translation of the word מקדש.
- In this context, we are in _Meseches Kiddushin_ so we know we are probably speaking about marriage, and so even though “מקדש” can have several meanings, here we are probably referring to a man who is creating the binding engagement stage of marriage called _kiddushin_ with one woman.
- However, the ongoing nature of the verb makes it sound like we are telling a story about a particular man doing this, but that seems a bit out of place here, and so we’ll have to remember that in the Mishnah, the ongoing “present tense” is used to communicate halachic rulings, and so if it says “we are making _kiddush_” that might mean “individuals are obligated to make kiddush” and if it says “a man is buying an item with a contract,” that would mean “a man is _able_ to buy an item using a contract.”
- Thus, the word מקדש here means “[a man is] able to create the _kiddushin_ stage of marriage [...],” and we are anticipating further details about how this is done.

Grammatical explanation of מקדש:
We can give a grammatical explanation of the word מקדש:
- מקדש comes from the [[shoresh]] קדש
- מקדש is from the [[{{pi’el}} binyan]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic]].)
- The meaning of מקדש is determined by the meanings of [the shoresh קדש in the pi’el].
- מקדש is a [[pi'el active participle]], an example of an [[active participle]] which is one of [[the two types of {{participle}}]].
- מקדש is in the masculine singular, so we are speaking about one man or one masculine entity.

How you could figure the meaning of מקדש out yourself:
Here's how you could figure out the meaning of מקדש yourself:
- First, let's remember that we're reading a Mishnah, and so the language is going to be Hebrew.
- We might know that there is a noun spelled מקדש, מִקְדָּשׁ meaning temple or sanctuary, but because we just saw האיש which is a noun, now we are probably looking for a verb.
- So, every verb should have 2-3 visible letters of the [[shoresh]], so we'll want to identify what shoresh this is.
- We have 4 [[strong letters]], so only three of those can be part of the verb, so either the מ is a prefix, or the ש is a suffix.
- There are [[several {{Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ}}]], but ש is never a suffix, so we've narrowed it down to those verb forms.
- The only one of those forms that has only a מ prefix and not an extra ת or י or ו is the [[{{pi'el active participle}} for regular shorushim]].
- Once we know the binyan and tense, we can see that the lack of a suffix indicates this is a masculine singular.

Literal translation of the full sentence:

Identify ambiguities:

Understand the first clause:
Now that we've read the first clause, we will ask some clarifying questions.
- [[How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?]]
- [[What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?]]
- [[What would I have thought if it didn’t say בו?]]
- [[What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?]]
- [[Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?]]

How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?
- There being three ways of understanding specificity
- Going through the options here

What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?

- Introduce the idea of there being three types of specificity, but leave it ambiguous until the Gemara which kind the Gemara thinks the Mishnah is.

What would I have thought if it didn’t say בו?

What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?

Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?
Is there someone whose mind we could read to see if R Yosef is correct about what he is saying?

[Gemara/Kiddushin/Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh/Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy/Pass 2/Sentence 01]

* Second pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
On the second pass, lets consider further questions we might have with this line:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
- (You can [[First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו|review the literal meaning of the line if you need to first]].)
- Think for yourself, and then consider these [[hints]]. (Think before clicking!)

Hints:
This clause of the Mishnah teaches that there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman.
- [[What questions might we have on {there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman|that}]]? (Think before clicking!)

What questions might we have on there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman:
R Yehuda HaNasi was the compiler of the Mishnah.
- We might ask, [[what did {R Yehuda HaNasi|he} put in {The Mishnah|it}?]]

What did R Yehuda HaNasi put in The Mishnah?
When R Yehuda HaNasi was writing the Mishnah, [[did {R Yehuda HaNasi|he} just write his personal opinions about various things?]]

Did R Yehuda HaNasi just write his personal opinions about various things?
Let's remember that when R Yehuda HaNasi wrote the Mishnah, he was encoding the oral understandings of Torah that had existed long before him.
- Lets see if [[{the fact that the Mishnah encodes the oral law|that} helps us think of a question on this Mishnah]].

The fact that the Mishnah encodes the oral law helps us think of a question on this Mishnah:
We might ask tangentially, [[what sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?]]

What sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?
Generally, we say that the Oral Torah contains the details of the mitzvos that Hashem chose not to put in the written Torah.
- If so, [[what is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?]]

What is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?
You might say:
- If the Oral Torah is for details of mitzvos mentioned in the written Torah, then perhaps we wouldn't expect the Oral Torah to include any mitzvos or details of mitzvos that aren't mentioned in the written Torah.
- [[Does the fact that the Oral Torah doesn't include mitzvos not written in the Torah help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that the Oral Torah doesn't include mitzvos not written in the Torah help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
So we have established thus far:
- The Oral Torah and thus the Mishnah are elaborating on what is written in the written Torah.
- Our Mishnah speaks about a man being allowed to make _kiddushin_ via a shaliach.
- [[Can we connect the Oral Torah elaborating on the written Torah with the din of the Mishnah?|Can we think of a question yet?]]

Can we connect the Oral Torah elaborating on the written Torah with the din of the Mishnah?
If the Oral Torah and thus the Mishnah only teaches the details of mitzvos mentioned in the written Torah, then perhaps we would expect things written in the Mishnah to relate to something written in the _Chumash_.
- [[Does the fact that things in the Mishnah should relate to something in the _chumash_ give us a question about this Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that things in the Mishnah should relate to something in the _chumash_ give us a question about this Mishnah?
So, the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which contains details of the things written in the written Torah.
- As another hint, our Mishnah is the first Mishnah to mention the idea that you can use a _shaliach_ to do a mitzvah.
- [[Does the fact that this Mishnah is the first to mention that you can use a _shaliach_ help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that this Mishnah is the first to mention that you can use a _shaliach_ help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
We said that the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which includes details of halachos written in the written Torah.
- We said that our Mishnah is the first to mention that you can do a mitzvah via _shaliach_.
- We also said the Mishnah is transmitting the Oral Law which merely ellaborates on what is said in the written Torah.
- So, you might ask, where in the _written_ Torah do we find a source for the ability to use a _shaliach_?

Think for yourself, and then consider these [[hints]][^1].
[^1]: You will improve much more quickly if you read the hints sparingly and try to figure out the answer yourself first.

Hints:
The Mishnah had an extra word, and R Yosef is coming to suggest that the extra word was included to teach the idea that it is better to do mitzvos yourself.
- Do we have [[any questions regarding this principle that R Yosef is mentioning]]? (Pause and think before reading.)

Any questions regarding this principle that R Yosef is mentioning:
R Yosef is telling us that even though you can do a mitzvah with a shaliach, it is better to do it yourself.

For the fourth pass:
| [[{Discussions By Line} of Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy]] | [[{Prose Summary} of Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy]] | [[{Halachos So Far} for Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy]] |


* Halachos So Far for Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy:
The Torah created a relationship called marriage, and created [[steps for initiating marriage]].

Steps for initiating marriage:
The Torah created:
- [[the state of _kiddushin_ and means to establish it]]
- [[the state of _nisuyin_ and means to establish it]].

The state of _kiddushin_ and means to establish it:
The Torah created the state of _kiddushin_, and:
- established [[various {{means to establish _kiddushin_}}]]
- designated [[various {{agents permitted to establish _kiddushin_}}]]
- enacted [[various {{requirements for the establishment of _kiddushin_}}]]

Means to establish _kiddushin_:
We learn in the first perek of Kiddushin that _kiddushin_ can be established with _kesef_ (money), _shtar_ (contract), or _biah_ (marital relations.)

Agents permitted to establish _kiddushin_:
We learn in the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a that a _shaliach_ is permitted to establish _kiddushin_ on behalf of his sender.
- However, we also learned that [[according to R Yosef it is “better” for a man to establish _kiddushin_ himself]].

According to R Yosef it is better for a man to establish _kiddushin_ himself:
According to R Yosef it is better for a man to establish _kiddushin_ himself:
- There are [[various opinions what R Yosef means for it to be “better” to do mitzvos yourself]]
- There are [[various opinions why marriage specifically is better to do yourself]].

Various opinions what R Yosef means for it to be “better” to do mitzvos yourself:
There are various opinions how doing a mitzvah yourself could be “better” than using a shaliach if both are still valid:
- The Rambam seems to imply that it is better to do mitzvos yourself because it gives more kavod to the mitzvah
- Rashi seems to imply that it is better to do mitzvos yourself because you get more schar, which is because your body is involved in the mitzvah

Various opinions why marriage specifically is better to do yourself:
Even if it is better to do mitzvos yourself, why does this apply to marriage?
- According to the Rambam who holds _kiddushin_ is a mitzvah, R Yosef can hold it is better to be _mekadesh_ yourself because it is better to do all mitzvos yourself.
- According to the Rosh who holds _kiddushin_ is only a _hechsher mitzvah_, R Yosef might hold it is better to be _mekadesh_ yourself because it is even better to do _hechsher mitzvos_ yourself.

Requirements for the establishment of _kiddushin_:
The Torah instituted various requirements for establishing _kiddushin_:
- We learn from the Gemara on Kiddusin 41a that [[it is _assur_ for a man to marry a woman without seeing her first]].

It is _assur_ for a man to marry a woman without seeing her first: Tosofos seems to think this is a true _issur_, whereas Rashi seems to think that it is a strong suggestion.

The state of _nisuyin_ and means to establish it:


* Prose Summary of Hashta B’shlucho Mekadesh Bo Meboy:
[[The Mishnah teaches that a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman himself or with a shaliach]].

The Mishnah teaches that a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman himself or with a shaliach:
[[The Gemara asks why the Mishnah needed to specify a man can be _mekadesh_ himself]].

The Gemara asks why the Mishnah needed to specify a man can be _mekadesh_ himself:
The Gemara brings two traditions of answers to the question why the tana included בו:
- [[R Yosef answers that the tana of the Mishnah included בו in order to teach the principle of _mitzvah bo yoser m'b'shlucho_]].
- [[An unnamed Amora suggests that the tana included בו to teach a halacha also taught by R Yehuda in the name of Rav that a man has to see a woman before marrying her]].

R Yosef answers that the tana of the Mishnah included בו in order to teach the principle of _mitzvah bo yoser m'b'shlucho_:

An unnamed amora suggests that the tana included בו to teach a halacha also taught by R Yehuda in the name of Rav that a man has to see a woman before marrying her:
The suggestion that בו is to teach a man must see the woman before marrying her presents several problems:
- What happened to R Yosef?
- Isn't that a stira to the Mishnah?

[Gur Aryeh]

- Question on Rashi, seems random
- It is a rule
- Why two answers?
- First answer has a better rule, second answer has a better timeline
- How can you say the first answer has a better rule when the Gur Aryeh uses the same lashon to describe the certainty of both rules?
- You can only know what a person is saying based on who they are speaking to, and what they are trying to exclude
- Who is the Gur Aryeh speaking to? Someone who disagrees with the rule? That assumes the audience has already read the Gur Aryeh.
- And, he offers no arguments.
- Also, the gur aryeh is here to explain Rashi, not to tell us his opinion, or debate with people who disagree, so it is unlikely that’s what he’s doing.
- Clearly he is speaking to someone who doesn’t have any idea there is a rule, and is coming to say “Rashi is coming from a rule”
- In which case, the fact he uses the same lashon for both rules doesn’t mean he thinks they’re equally good, and so he can agree to our pros/cons
- Gur Aryeh might even be warning us about the requirements of both answers
- Rashi thinks there is a chisaron with each answer, but the answers themselves are absolutist, and Gur Aryeh is telling us that the first answer holds the rule to be absolute, ie the Gur Aryeh’s strong lashon is to communicate the strength with which the first answer would have to hold what it holds for it to work as an answer

Why not two halachos to learn and two makomos? We see from the Gemara’s aval that you need to be clear about your source.
