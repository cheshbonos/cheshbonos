[Cheshbonos]

** Cheshbonos: This is a beta version of Cheshbonos, a tool for improving Gemara skills. You can navigate by using the mouse or arrow keys. Cheshbonos should be used with a Gemara. At the moment Cheshbonos offers help in learning [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]]. You can also [[learn more about the project]].

Learn more about the project: Cheshbonos has a [[dedication]]. Cheshbonos is published with various [[disclaimers]]. You can post your questions or comments on the [issues page](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/issues). You can sign up for occasional [[email updates]]. You can download the Cheshbonos [desktop app](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/releases/tag/latest). Cheshbonos is built using [Canopy.js](https://github.com/canopy-js/canopy-js).

Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such people should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for individuals who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning. Cheshbonos can be downloaded and used without an internet connection, and the existence of web access does not represent an endorsement of internet use.

Dedication: Cheshbonos is dedicated to the memory of Rav Dov Zemmel z'l, a talmid muvak of R Chayim Pinchas Scheinberg, who taught dozens of talmidim to learn Gemara in an authentic and accurate way. This tool is inspired by the derech halimud he imparted to his talmidim.


[Gemara]

* Talmud Bavli: The Talmud Bavli is a commentary on the Mishnah. Talmud Bavli [[follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah]].

Follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah: There is Talmud Bavli on Seder Moed, [[Seder Nashim]], Seder Nezikin, Seder Kodashim, and Seder Tahoros.

Seder Nashim: Seder Nashim of Talmud Bavli includes Yevamot, Ketubot, Nedarim, Nazir, Sotah, Gittin, and [[Maseches Kiddushin|Kiddushin]].


[Gemara/Kiddushin]

* Maseches Kiddushin: Maseches Kiddushin is a masechta of [[Seder Nashim]] in [[Talmud Bavli]]. It has several [[perakim]].

Perakim: The first perek of Meseches Kiddushin is Perek Ha'isha Niknas. The second perek of Maseches Kiddushin is [[Perek Ha'Ish Mekadesh]].


[Gemara/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a]

* Kiddushin 41a:
Kiddushin 41a can be seen [[{{picture}}d here]]. It contains [[{the|a}{ mishnah} on Kiddushin 41a]], and the sugya of hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya.

Picture: ![Kiddushin 41a Vilna Edition](/_assets/dafim/Kiddushin_41a.png "Kiddushin 41a" "Kiddushin 41a Vilna Romm Edition 1880-86CE, courtesy of Sefaria.org")


* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is [[{{picture}}d here]]. The text of the Mishnah reads:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
The Mishnah has a [[first clause]], a [[second clause]], and a [[third clause]].

Picture: ![Kiddushin 41a Vilna Edition](/_assets/dafim/Kiddushin_41a_mishnah.png "Kiddushin 41a" "Kiddushin 41a Vilna Romm Edition 1880-86CE, courtesy of Sefaria.org")

First clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
This is the first clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the first clause]], a [[literal translation of the first clause]], a [[contextual translation of the first clause]], [[Rishonim on the first clause]], and [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Contextual translation of the first clause: Because it is a rule of _mishnayos_ that a present-tense sentence in a Mishnah is generally not telling a story but is giving a _psak_, a contextual translation of the first clause of the Mishnah would read:
> A man is allowed to be _mekadesh_ (a woman), either via himself or via a _shaliach_

Rishonim on the first clause: Rashi and Tosofos discuss the first clause.

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya.

Words of the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]].

The word האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה]].

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means "man."

The prefix ה: The prefix ה in Hebrew means "the."

The word מקדש: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") means making something holy, usually used in the context of a man creating the legal status of "kiddushin" with a woman prior to marriage. For those interested in grammar, it can be used in several [[parts of speech]], and is the [[the participle tense of the Hebrew intensive-active binyan of the shoresh קדש]] in the [[masculine singular]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning "someone who makes something holy", a verb, someone or something "is making holy," or an adjective, something has "the quality of making something holy."

The word בו: The word בו means "with/on/inside of/because of him/it." For those interested in grammar, it is [[the prefix ב]] with a [[third-person masculine singular suffix]].

The word ובשלוחו: This is [[the prefix ו]], followed by [[the prefix ב]], followed by [[the word שלוח]], followed by [[the noun suffix ו]].

The prefix ו: The prefix ו usually means "and," but can also mean "or."

The word שלוח: The word שלוח means "someone or something that is sent." For those interested in grammar, it is [[masculine singular]] of the [[_pa'al_ passive participle tense of the shoresh שלח]].

The noun suffix ו: The suffix ו when applied to a noun means "of him" or "of it."

Literal translation of the first clause: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal translation might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Pshat in the first clause: A pshat in the first clause of the Mishna might be:
> A man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh a woman, himself or with a shaliach

Second clause:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the second clause]], a [[literal translation of the second clause]], and a [[pshat in the second clause]].

Words of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Third clause:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the third clause]], a [[literal translation of the third clause]], and a [[pshat in the third clause]].

Words of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the third clause: This is a work in progress.


[Gemara/Kiddushin/Perakim/Ha'ish Mekadesh]

* Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh: You can  navigate _Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh_ [[by daf]] or [[by Mishnah]]. Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh is the second perek of [[Maseches Kiddushin]].

By daf: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh covers eighteen daf, beginning on [[Kiddushin 41a]] and ending on Kiddushin 58b.

By Mishnah: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh begins with [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]].


[Lashonos/Binyanim]

* Binyan: Binyan has a [[definition]]. There are [[seven binyanim]].

Definition: A binyan is a permutation of a [[shoresh]] in Hebrew and Aramaic that realizes the general meaning of the shoresh into a particular action or quality. A shoresh might have a general meaning of "holy," whereas a particular binyan of that shoresh might mean "to make something holy," or "to be holy."

Seven binyanim: Both Hebrew and Aramaic have seven binyanim, although they have slightly different names due to the [[binyan naming convention]]. The binyanim are the simple-active, the simple-passive, the [[intensive-active binyan|intensive-active]], the intensive-passive, the causative-active, the causative-passive, and the reflexive.

Binyan naming convention: Binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic are named after the third-person masculine conjugation of the shoresh פעל in that binyan. So, for example, the [[intensive-active binyan]] is called the "pi'el", (פִּעֵל),


* Intensive-active binyan: The intensive-active binyan, also known as the "pi'el" (פִּעֵל) in Hebrew, is a [[binyan]] that exists in Hebrew and Aramaic. It is called the "intensive" because shorushim that are converted into verbs by putting them in the intensive often assume a meaning that is a more "intense" version of the idea that is represented by the shoresh itself. [Add example].


[Lashonos/Concepts]

* Shoresh: A shoresh is a short series of letters that gets combined into different permutations to produce different words in Hebrew and Aramaic. Most shorushim have three clear letters, although some have only two clear letters, and grammarians differ as to whether to consider these "weak" shorushim as really having only two letters, or whether to think of them as containing a third letter like י or ה

[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].

Rashi and Tosofos are daf subtopics?

Why not two halachos to learn and two makomos? We see from the Gemara's aval that you need to be clear about your source.
