If you are new to Gemara, you can use the [[{{getting started}} guide]]. You can also [[learn more about the project]].

Learn more about the project: Cheshbonos has a [[dedication]]. Cheshbonos is published with various [[disclaimers]]. You can post your questions or comments on the [issues page](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/issues). You can sign up for occasional [[email updates]]. You can download the Cheshbonos [desktop app](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/releases/tag/latest). Cheshbonos is built using [Canopy.js](https://github.com/canopy-js/canopy-js).

Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such people should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for individuals who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning. Cheshbonos can be downloaded and used without an internet connection, and the existence of a web interface does not represent an endorsement of internet use.

Haaras
=============================
- Mishna
  -Rosh and Rambam?
- Gemara's Kasha:
  - three meanings of specificity
  - which mahalach is the gemara taking in its question
  - what is the makor for this?
  - How would you learn "haish mekadesh bshlucho"?
  - Where do we see the Gemara thinks shlichus is the bigger chiddush?
  - "also" "even" "for example"
- First answer
  - where does halacha come from
  - reason for shver mishnas
  - what is the amoritic story for?
  - What mitzvah is kiddushin? machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah, the fact that R Yosef says mitzvah ie where do we find a raya to the rambam and how does the Rosh handle it? (Maybe ask "what mitzvah is it" and introduce Rosh and Rambam here.)
  - Rosh baked matzas
  - What entitles R Yosef to say he knows what Rebbe meant?
  - Are Amoriam saying mesoras or theories?
  - What about the Mishnah makes it a proof for R Yosef's halacha?
- Amoriam
  - Who is saying this?
  - Question of what they are proving
  - line up with shitas of machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah
  - shaarei tzion inside
- Second answer
  - stira to mishna
  - mialas and chisronos of both answers
  - not the same distinctions & who says that is the ookimpta and why are stam cases presumed stam
  - what is an ika damri, pnei yoshua: does the first answer not know about the second answer?
  - What does the nami mean?
  - Isn't he an oness?
  - Clarify that it isn't RYAR's halacha, we are presuming the Tana would know you have to see the woman first etc.
- Ki itmar DRav Yosef:
  - Why didn't the gemara stop there?
  - difference between intro of R Yosef and intro of R Yehuda amar Rav, R Yosef needs a total proof, why not say "one and one"?
  - Why didn't we have to move R Yehuda amar Rav?
  - Is this editing a memra of R Yosef, or was there never any memra?
  - Why does R Yosef get knocked off?
  - Why not just make it a machlochus / standard ika damri where there are multiple conflicting girsas?
  - Maybe we are moving R Yosef to explain the bah? But we don't see this in the shakla v'taria.
  - Why doesn't RYAR need a source for his halacha?
  - Why the Gemara concludes R Yosef must be moved
    1. R Yosef isn't using a lashon of machlochus, he seems to be speaking as if he is the only game in town
    2. R Yosef agrees to RYAR's halacha in theory
    3. RYAR's halacha would objectively fit the "bo" and so can't be rejected out of hand as a possibility
    4. RY is definitely speaking about our mishna
    Thus, there is a stira in R Yosef
  - How can you call what she's doing a mitzvah?
    - vies tois a mesaye
    - But if a mesaye is called a mitzvah, why isn't a mesaye called an aviera such that the ki itmar answer doesn't work?
- Aval
  - set up Rashi
  - chazon ish emuna bitachon

[Gemara/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a/Mishna]

* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is [[{{picture}}d here]] and quoted below.
< [[האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו]] [[האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה]] [[האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו]]

Context of the Mishnah: The Mishnah has [[required background information]], a [[position in the perek]], and relates to a particular [[subject matter]].

Required background information: This Mishnah presumes familiarity with the [[_halachic_ steps of marriage]], and with the [[concept of _shlichus_]].

_Halachic_ steps of marriage: In Jewish law, a state of marriage is produced by two steps, [[_kiddushin_]] and [[_nisuyin_]].

_kiddushin_: The first step of Jewish marriage is called _erusin_ or _kiddushin_. After _kiddushin_, the woman is designated to the man for marriage and would need a halachic divorce in order to remarry. However, the couple is not yet married, and may not live together or have physical contact. The first Mishnah of _Maseches Kiddushin_ discusses the different ways in which a man and woman can produce a state of _kiddushin_. _Kiddushin_ is sometimes translated as "engagement" although the binding nature of _kiddushin_ is one difference between it and ordinary engagement.

_nisuyin_: The second step of Jewish marriage is called _nisuyin_. After _kiddushin_, the couple must create a state of _nisuyin_ in order to be formally married. In the times of the Gemara _nisuyin_ might be done a year after _kiddushin_. Today, however, _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are done in the same wedding ceremony. Typically _nisuyin_ is done by having the wife enter the residence of the groom, either his actual residence, or more commonly the _chupah_ or _yichud_ room.

Concept of _shlichus_: In _halacha_, there are various actions a person can do that produce _halachic_ consequences, such as buying and selling goods, or doing a _mitzvah_ like giving _tzeddukah_. In this _perek_, we will see that some of these actions can be performed by an emissary, or _shaliach_, who is designated beforehand by the individual, and the individual is credited with the action the emissary performs. Which actions can be done via _shaliach_ and other questions regarding _shlichus_ will be the primary topic of this Mishnah and the Gemaras that discuss it.

Position in the perek: This is the first Mishnah in the second _perek_ of _Maseches Kiddushin_. The first _perek_ began by discussing the different methods a man can use to be _mekadesh_ a woman, and this Mishnah will continue to discuss related topics.

Subject matter: This Mishnah will discuss which aspects of the marriage process can be done via a _shaliach_. Think to yourself now, what parts would you guess can be done by _shaliach_, and which parts would you think one wouldn't be able to do via _shaliach_?

Picture: ![Kiddushin 41a Vilna Edition](/_assets/dafim/Kiddushin_41a_mishnah.png "Kiddushin 41a" "Kiddushin 41a Vilna Romm Edition 1880-86CE, courtesy of Sefaria.org")

האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
The first clause of the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is quoted below. The first clause has [[context]], [[content]], and [[commentary]].
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו

Context: Before learning the first clause, you can consider [[what you would guess the halacha to be]].

What you would guess the halacha to be: The first clause of the Mishnah is discussing whether a man can halachically engage a woman via a messenger without himself being present. Before reading on, stop and ask yourself, do you think this would work? Why or why not?

Content: To learn the first clause of the Mishna inside, we must [[identify the sentence break]], understand the [[individual words]], produce a [[literal translation]], and a cumulative [[interpretation]].

Identify the sentence break:
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? By reading the Mishnah, we should notice a pattern where we have a person (האיש / האיש), followed by some action (מקדש / מתקדשת), followed by some reference to _shlichus_ (מקדש בו / בה ובשלוחה).
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can focus first on the first one.

Individual words:
These are the individual words of the first clause:
< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]

האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה]].

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means "man."

The prefix ה: The prefix ה in Hebrew means "the."

מקדש: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") has a [[basic explanation]] and [[advanced explanation]].

Basic explanation: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") means "making something holy," usually used in the context of a man creating the legal status of "kiddushin" with a woman prior to marriage, but also, for example, Hashem being _mekadesh es ha'shabbos_ ie making the Shabbos holy.

Advanced explanation: For those interested in grammar, the word מקדש is the the _pi'el_ participle of [[the shoresh קדש]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning "someone who makes something holy", a verb, someone or something "is making holy," or an adjective, something has "the quality of making something holy."

בו: The word בו can mean "with him/it," "on him/it," "inside him/it," and "because of him/it." For those interested in grammar, it is [[the prefix ב]] with a [[{pronominal suffix}es]].

ובשלוחו: This is [[the prefix ו]], followed by [[the prefix ב]], followed by [[the word שלוח]], followed by [[the noun suffix ו]].

The prefix ו: The prefix ו usually means "and," but can also mean "or."

The word שלוח: The word שלוח means "someone or something that is sent." For those interested in grammar, it is [[masculine singular]] of the [[_pa'al_ passive participle tense of the shoresh שלח]].

The noun suffix ו: The suffix ו when applied to a noun means "of him" or "of it."

- The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]]. Try to figure out the meaning of the sentence from the definitions of the individual words.

Literal translation:

Interpretation: Synthesize context and content into a summary, and see eg does the content and the context fit, is this an answer, etc. - With questions and mehalchim.

Commentary: There are [[{{observations we can make}} on the first clause]], [[mefarshim on the first clause]], and [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Observations we can make: There are observations we can make on the first clause. First, [[that it says "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

That it says "bo u'b'shlucho": In order to understand what is interesting about this wording, let's observe that there are [[several things you can mean when giving examples]], and then ask [[whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

Several things you can mean when giving examples: If I tell you "you're invited to come drive to my wedding," I might mean one of three things:
- A diyuk: I am telling you that you are only invited to come to my wedding if you come by car.
- Lav davka: I am giving an example of how you could come, but what I mean is that any way is fine
- Biggest chiddush: I am telling you that you can come any way, _even_ driving, implying that for some reason it is more surprising that you'd be allowed to drive than other examples, and that all the more so it is also fine to use less-surprising forms of transportation.

Whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho": When the Mishnah gives an example of how something is done, does it generally mean for you to understand it as a diyuk, a lav-davka example, or as the biggest chiddush, and all the more so the din applies to less surprising cases?

Mefarshim on the first clause: [[Rashi on Kiddushin 41a _ha'ish mekadesh bo u'b'shlucho_]] discusses the first clause of the Mishnah.

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboy]].

Literal translation of the first clause: A literal translation of the first clause of the Mishnah might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah.

האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah.

[Lashonos/Binyanim]

* Binyan: "Binyan" is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English. Binyanim are [[related to shorushim]]. There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].

Related to shorushim: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, a _binyan_ of that shoresh would represent a specific verb or adjective within that range of meaning. A shoresh like קדש might have the general meaning "holiness" whereas a particular binyan of that shoresh might produce the specific verb "to make something holy," or "to be holy."


* Binyanim: There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].


* Intensive: There are several [["intensive" binyanim]] in Hebrew and Aramaic. They are called "intensive" because the verbs that are produced by putting shorushim in those binyanim often assume a meaning that is a more "intense" or repetitive version of the idea that is represented by the shoresh itself. For example, the shoresh שבר expresses the general idea of things breaking, whereas the _pi'el_ verb of שבר,‎ לְשַׁבֵּר, means "to shatter."

"Intensive" binyanim: There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic, in Hebrew the [[active {{_pi'el_}}]] and the [[passive {{pu'al}}]], and in Aramaic the [[active {{pa'el}}]] and the [[passive {{ispa'al}}]].


[Lashonos/Binyanim/Aramaic]

* Af'el:


* Aramaic binyanim: There six binyanim in Aramaic, the [[pe'al]], the [[ispe'el]], the [[pa'el]], the [[ispa'al]], the [[af'el]], and the [[isaf'al]]. Aramaic is missing a passive intensive binyan corresponding to the [[Hebrew {{pu'al}}]].

[Lashonos/Entities]

* Shoresh: A shoresh is a grammatical entity in Hebrew and Aramaic. Shorushim have an [[appearance]], a [[meaning]], a [[function]], and a [[more precise definition]].

Appearance: A shoresh looks like a series of 2-3 letters like קדש or מת.

Meaning: A shoresh represents a broad category of meaning, like "holiness" for קדש, or "death" for מת.

Function: A shoresh is used to generate many more specific words. For example, the shoresh קדש "holiness" is used to generate the verb להקדיש, "to donate something to the beis hamikdash."

More precise definition: Most shorushim have three clear letters, although some like מת have only two clear letters, and traditional grammarians differ as to whether to consider these "weak" shorushim as being "two letter shorushim," or whether to think of them as being three letter shorushim with a hidden third letter like י or ה.

[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].

Rashi and Tosofos are daf subtopics?

Why not two halachos to learn and two makomos? We see from the Gemara's aval that you need to be clear about your source.

Nami being the Gemara speaking.

You can tell ב isn't short for בתוך because there is also מתוך

First kasha - ways of reading the mishna even/only/for example. 2nd answer of the gemara - oddity of seeing vs shlichus, R Yosef vs RYAR being there, after 2 answers - why doesn't the gemara stop.

First establish _that_ a text is an answer, then ask _whether_ it is ie actually an answer.
