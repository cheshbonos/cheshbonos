[Cheshbonos]

** Cheshbonos: This is an early beta version of Cheshbonos, a tool for improving Gemara skills. You can navigate by using the mouse or arrow keys. You can use Cheshbonos to learn [[Kiddushin 41a]]. If you are new to Gemara, you can use the [[{{getting started}} guide]]. You can also [[learn more about the project]].

Learn more about the project: Cheshbonos has a [[dedication]]. Cheshbonos is published with various [[disclaimers]]. You can post your questions or comments on the [issues page](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/issues). You can sign up for occasional [[email updates]]. You can download the Cheshbonos [desktop app](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/releases/tag/latest). Cheshbonos is built using [Canopy.js](https://github.com/canopy-js/canopy-js).

Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such people should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for individuals who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning. Cheshbonos can be downloaded and used without an internet connection, and the existence of a web interface does not represent an endorsement of internet use.

Dedication: Cheshbonos is dedicated to the memory of Rav Dov Zemmel z'l, a talmid muvak of R Chayim Pinchas Scheinberg, who taught dozens of talmidim to learn Gemara in an authentic and accurate way. This tool is inspired by the _derech halimud_ he imparted to his talmidim.


[Cheshbonos/Guide]

* Getting Started: This will be expanded to include a history of the Mishnah and Gemara for beginners.


[Dikduk]

* How to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic: This is what you need to know to identify a verb in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Every verb comes from a [[shoresh]].
- A shoresh gets put into a [[“binyan”]] which produces a verb, which might have several possible meanings.
- A verb is then conjugated into a particular [[verb {form}s of Hebrew and Aramaic]], like the [[future tense]] or [[infinitive]].
- Within a form there are several “persons,” eg “first-person” (“I run”) or “second-person” (“you run”), etc.
- So, when we see a verb in the Gemara, we want to identify the shoresh, the binyan, the form, and the person.


* Strong letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “strong” in that if they are part of a [[shoresh]] then they will appear in all verbs formed from that shoresh.
- Strong letters are those that are not [[weak letters]].


* Vowel shift for ח and ע: When ח or ע are after a vowel sound like “ei,” sometimes a second vowel sound “ah” is added.
- For example, the [[_pa’al_ active participle for regular shorushim]] has an “ei” vowel sound, eg כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, he is writing.)
- However, the [[pa’al active participle for shorushim ending with ח or ע]] has two vowel sounds, eg פּוֹתֵחַ (_posei-ach_, he is opening.)
- Some linguists bring this as [[evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters]].

Evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters:
Some linguists bring vowel changes for shorushim ending in ח or ע as evidence for a shift in their pronunciation:
- We generally pronounce ח like we do כ, and ע like we do א.
- However, some linguists point to the fact that “gutteral” letters like ח or ע receive an “extra” vowel sound (_po-say-ach_ as opposed to, e.g. _kos-eiv)_ as evidence that the original sounds of ח and ע were different from כ and א.
- The real sound for a ח or ע might have been so low in the throat, that the jaw would need to open fully to pronounce them, causing the vowel shift from “ei” to “ah.”
- This is as opposed to the כ or א letters which are similar to ח and ע but which are pronounced at the back of the mouth, without opening the throat, and can therefore accomidate an “ei” vowel, eg הוֹלֵךְ (_holeich_, [he] is walking), or בּוֹרֵא (_borei_, [he] is creating.)


* Weak letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “weak” in that it is not clear if they are part of a word’s [[shoresh]] or whether they are added as vowels or part of a conjugation. Sometimes, weak letters act as consonants, and are pronounced strongly.
- The weak letters are ‎א, ‎ע, ‎ה, ‎ח, ‎י, ‎ו, and ‎נ.
- Letters that are not weak are [[strong letters]].


[Dikduk/Aramaic]

* Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Words like “running” which are called “participles” require a pronoun like “I” to clarify who is doing the action, eg “I am running.”
- In Aramaic, we can attach the pronoun to the end of the verb, for example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- (As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].)
- These are the Aramaic words that get added as suffixes:
| ‎אֲנָא ‎ <br><br> _anau_ <br><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | ‎אַתְּ‎ <br><br> _at_ <br><br><br> You [man or woman] |
| ‎אֲנַן‎ <br><br> _anan_ <br><br><br> We | ‎אַתּוּ‎ <br><br> _atu_ <br><br><br> You [men or women] |


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim/Af’el]

* Af’el: The “Af’el” (אַפְעֵל) is one of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- A verb in the _af’el_ often has a meaning of making someone else take on properties of the [[shoresh]].
- For example, the shoresh שמע means “hearing or understanding,” and the _af’el_ verb אַשְׁמַע means “to make someone else hear or understand,” ie to teach.

[Dikduk/Binyan]

* Active: “Active” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Active verbs represent actions where [[the person being described is the one doing the action]], as opposed to [[{{passive}} verbs]].
- There are [[several {{active binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is the one doing the action: Active verbs represent actions where the person being described is the one doing the action, as opposed to [[passive]] verbs. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |

 the verb לִקְנוֹת means “to buy,” and because it is active, the one being described is the one who is buying, as opposed to describing the thing being bought.


* Active binyanim:
There are several [[active]] binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Actives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Pa’al_]]  | [[_Pi’el_]] | [[_Hif’il_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |


* Binyan: “Binyan” is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English.
- If you take a [[shoresh]], for example אכל, which represents “eating,” and put it into a certain “binyan,” you produce a verb, for example לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_, which means “to feed.”
- You can identify the binyan of a verb by its vowel sounds. Other verbs that rhyme with לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_ will have similar meanings, because they are from the same “binyan.”
- Every conjugated verb has one shoresh and one binyan.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the concept of binyan]].

Learn more about the concept of binyan:
Here is additional explanation of the concept of “binyan”:
- Binyanim of a shoresh are [[like different flavors of the shoresh meaning]].
- Every binyan is a combination of [[five basic types of action]].
- There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].
- There are also [[nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim]].

Like different flavors of the shoresh meaning: You can think of a binyan as being a “flavor” that gets mixed with the shoresh to produce different verbs. For example:
| *The shoresh* | *Can be put into a binyan called* | *Which has a “flavor” of* | *And produces the verb* |
| אכל <br> eating | [[_hif’il_]] | causing someone else to do something | eating + causing = <br> “to feed” |
| כתב <br> writing | [[_pi’el_]] | doing something more intensely | writing + intense = <br> “to engrave” |
| קנה <br> buying | [[_nif’al_]] | having something done to you | buying + <br> something done to you = <br> “to be purchased” |
In English [[we use alternative means to achieve the same effect]].

Five basic types of action: There are five “types” of action that get combined to produce different binyanim:
- [[Active]]: Someone doing something themselves
- [[Passive]]: Someone having something done to them
- [[Simple]]: Someone doing a very straight-forward version of an action
- [[Intensive]]: Someone doing an intense or repetitive version of an action
- [[Causative]]: Someone causing someone else do an action
All of the different [[Hebrew Binyanim|binyanim of Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic Binyanim|of Aramaic]] are different combinations of these five ideas. For example, the [[_hif’il_]] is “active,” and “causative.”

We use alternative means to achieve the same effect: In English, we do not use “binyan” to produce families of related verbs.
- Rather, in English you have one simple verb like “eat,” and then you add other words to form larger ideas like “he made someone eat,” or “he was eaten,” etc, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic those permutations are baked into the verb itself.
- Additionally, in English, words like “buy” and “sell” have no visual similarity, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, “to buy” (לִקְנוֹת) and “to sell” (לְהִיקָּנוֹת) would be “two binyans” of the same shoresh (קנה), and would share many of the same letters.

Nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim: Every verb has one binyan, and there are nouns and adjectives that come from a verb in a particular binyan.
- For example, from every _pi’el_ verb you can produce a _pi’el_ noun with the same meaning by using [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]].

A shoresh is put “into” a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל “to eat,” לְהַאֲכִיל “to feed,” or adjective אָכוּל “eaten.”


* Binyanim: There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].


* Causative: “Causative” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Causative verbs often describe [[an action that makes something else change]]. A binyan that is causative has verbs that are causative and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]]:

An action that makes something else change: Causative verbs often describe an action that makes someone or something else become a certain way. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Causative verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to make someone else eat (ie to feed) |
| חזר | to return | to make something return (ie to return something) |
| בוה | to come | to make something come (ie to bring something) |
| זכר | to remember | to make something be remembered (ie to mention) |

Several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] causative binyan is called the [[_hif’il_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] causative binyan is called the [[_huf’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” causative binyan is called the [[_af’el_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” causative binyan is called the [[_itaf’al_]]


* Intensive: “Intensive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Intensive verbs often have meanings that are [[intensive or repetitive]].
- A binyan that is intensive has verbs that are intensive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are [[several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Intensive or repetitive: Intensive verbs often have meanings that are more intensive or repetitive versions of their associated [[shoresh]], although sometimes the meaning is [[causative]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple Verb* | *Intensive Verb* |
|-|-|-|
| שבר | to break | to shatter |
| ישב | to sit | to create a settlement |
| כתב | to write | to engrave |
Ultimately these are just rules of thumb, and you can never be sure exactly what an intensive verb will mean just by looking at the meaning of its shoresh generally.

Several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s [[active]] intensive binyan is the [[_pi’el_]]
- Hebrew’s [[passive]] intensive binyan is the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s active intensive binyan is the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s passive intensive [[_ispa’al_]]


* Passive: “Passive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Passive verbs usually represent actions where [[the person being described is having an action done to them]], as opposed to [[{{active}} verbs]]
- A binyan that is passive has verbs that are passive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are several [[{{passive binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is having an action done to them: Passive verbs represent actions where the thing being described is having an action done to them, as opposed to verbs that are [[active]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |
This is a rule of thumb, although sometimes passive verbs have [[{{reflexive}} meanings]].


* Passive binyanim:
There are several [[passive]] binyanim in Hebrew and in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Passives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Nif’al_]]  | [[_Pu’al_]] | [[_Huf’al_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |


* Reflexive: “Reflexive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Reflexive verbs often refer to [[circular]] or [[transformative actions]].
- A binyan that is reflexive has verbs that are reflexive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are [[several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Circular: Reflexive verbs often describe an action where the doer does something to themselves, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| לבש | to dress | to dress oneself |
| בדד | to seperate | to go into isolation |
| בלל | to mix | to assimilate |
| גדר | to fence | to limit oneself to something |
 the shoresh לבש corresponds to the concept of clothing, and the causative verb from that shoresh is לְהִתְלַבֵּשׁ, which means “to dress oneself.”

Transformative actions: Reflexive verbs can also refer to situations where an entity undergoes a transformation, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| חדש | to be new | to revitalize |
| זקן | to be old | to grow old |
| חרש | to be deaf | to become deaf |

Several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s reflexive binyan is called the [[_hispa’el_]]
- Aramaic’s [[passive]] binyanim, [[_ispe’el_]], [[ispa’al]], and [[itaf’al]], can also be reflexive.
- In general [[{{passive}} verbs]] can also sometimes have reflexive meanings.


* Simple: “Simple” (also known as _kal)_ is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Simple verbs usually have [[meanings that are similar to their shoresh]]. A binyan that is simple has verbs that are simple and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Meanings that are similar to their shoresh: Simple verbs have meanings that are very similar to their associated [[shoresh]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *Simple verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | eating | to eat |
| הלח | walking | to walk |
| אמר | speech | to say |
| ישב | sitting | to sit |

 the shoresh אכל represents the idea of eating, whereas the simple verb of that shoresh is לֶאֱכוֹל, which means “to eat.”

Several simple binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] simple binyan is called the [[_pa’al_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] simple binyan is called the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” simple binyan is called the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” simple binyan is called the [[_ispe’el_]]


* Stative verbs: Stative verbs are a category of verb that sometimes have special conjugations in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- A stative verb usually describe static qualities as opposed to actions.
| *Example stative verb* | *Meaning* |
| כּבֵד | to be heavy |
| חָכַם | to be wise |
| זָקֵן | to be old |
- Stative verbs are found in the [[simple]] binyanim, [[_pa’al_]] for Hebrew and [[_pe’al_]] for Aramaic.


[Dikduk/Forms]

* Active Participle: The active participle, usually just called “the participle” (and sometimes called _lashon po’el)_ is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- In English, an example of the active participle is the word “running.”
- The active participle can be used to make sentences like “I am running,” or “I was running.”
- Students interested in grammar can read [[additional information about the active participle]].

Additional information about the active participle:
This is additional information about the active participle:
- The active participle describes an ongoing action, as opposed to [[the {{passive participle}}]].
- Participles can only be used when combined with other words in special combinations called [[participle {constructions}]].
- The active participle has [[{forms } of the active participle {in Hebrew}]] and [[{forms } of the active participle {in Aramaic}]].


* Forms of the active participle in Aramaic:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| Binyan        | Type | Example | Transliteration |
|---------------|------|---------|----------------|
| [[_Pe’al_]] | [[simple]], [[active]] | כָּתֵיב | _kauseiv_ |
| [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | מִתְכְּתִב | _miskesiv_ |
| [[_Pa’el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְקַדֵּיש | _mekad’deish_ |
| [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְתְקַדַש | _miskadash_ |
| [[_Af’el_]] | [[causative]], [[active]] | מַכְתִּיב | _machtiv_ |
| [[_Itaf’al_]] | [[causative]] [[passive]], or [[reflexive]] | מִתַּפְקַד | _mitafkad_ |

For gender and number:
The participle is conjugated for gender and number:
| Person | Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Masculine singular | כּוֹתֵב | _koseiv_ | one man writing |
| Feminine singular | כּוֹתֶבֶת | _koseves_ | one woman writing |
| Masculine plural | כּוֹתְבִים | _kosvim_ | multiple men writing |
| Feminine plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosvos_ | multiple women writing |
This is unlike the [[past tense]] or [[future tense]] that have [[separate forms for person]]. This is because the participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is [[like an adjective]].

Separate forms for person: Tenses other than the participle have conjugations for every person, eg the [[_pa’al_]] [[past tense]]:
| *Person* | *Hebrew* | *Transliteration* | *Meaning* |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| First singular | כָּתַבְתִּי | _kosavti_ | I wrote |
| First-person plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosavnu_ | We wrote |
| Second singular masculine | כָּתַבְתָּ | _kosavto_ | You (man) wrote |
| Second singular feminine | כָּתַבְתְּ | _kosavt_ | You (woman) wrote |
| Second plural masculine | כְּתַבְתֶּם | _ksavtem_ | You (men) wrote |
| Second plural feminine | כְּתַבְתֶּן | _ksavten_ | You (women) wrote |
| Third plural masculine | כָּתַב | _kosav_ | He wrote |
| Third plural feminine | כָּתְבָה | _kosvo_ | She wrote |
| They/those | כָּתְבוּ | _kosvu_ | They wrote |

Like an adjective: The participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is more like an adjective than a verb, with “he is running” having the same grammatical form as “he is tall.” (This example uses the participle of the [[_{{pa’al}} binyan_]]. [[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)


* Forms of the active participle in Hebrew:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Hebrew binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Hebrew* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] | [[Reflexive]] |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| [[Active]]  | [[_Pa’al_ Active Participle|Active Participle <br> (of the _pa’al_)]] | [[_Pi’el_ (Active Participle)]] | _Hif’il_ (Active Participle) | _Hispa’el_ (Active Participle), <br><br> _Nispa’el_ (Active Participle) |
| [[Passive]] | _Nif’al_ (Active Participle) | _Pu’al_ (Active Participle) | _Huf’al_ (Active Participle) | \^ |

- Table might be overkill
| *Binyan*        | *Type* |  *Example* | *Transliteration* | *See all forms* |
| [[_Pa’al_]] | [[simple]], [[active]] | כּוֹתֵב | _koiseiv_ | [[Pa’al#Active Participle]] |
| [[_Nif’al_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | נִכְתָּב | _nicht’tov_ | Nif’al#Participle |
| [[_Pi’el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְכַתֵּב | _mechat’teiv_ | Pi’el#Participle |
| [[_Pu’al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְכֻתָּב | _mechut’tov_ | _Pu’al#Participle |

| [[_Hispa’el_]] | [[reflexive]] | מִתְכַּתֵּב | _miskat’teiv_ | Hispa’el#Participle |


* Future Tense: The future tense is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- The future tense generally describes a future action.
- However, the future tense has [[several alternative uses]].

Several alternative uses: The future tense generally describes a future action, however:
- The future tense [[can describe a command]].
- The future tense [[can describe a moral suggestion]].
- The future tense [[can describe a prayer]].

Can describe a command: The future tense can describe a command.
- For example, תִּכְתֹּב (_tichtov_, literally “you will write,”) can mean “you _shall_ write.”
- The _Torah_ generally expresses positive commandments using the [[{{imperative}} form]], but negative commandments are often expressed using the future tense, such as לֹא תִּרְצָח, “thou shalt not kill.”

Can describe a prayer:
The future tense can describe a prayer.
- For example, השם יְרַחֵם, _Hashem yeracheim_ (literally “Hashem will be compassionate”) can mean “I pray Hashem will be compassionate.”
- It may be that this usage is just an example of the former category of “moral suggestion,” i.e. the speaker may literally be saying “Hashem _should be_ compassionate,” by which he means “I hope that Hashem is compassionate.”

Can describe a moral suggestion:
The future tense can describe a moral suggestion.
- For example, תַּעֲזֹר, _ta’azoir_ (lit. “you will help”) can mean “you should help.”


* Imperative: The imperative, also known as “the command form,” is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an imperative in English is “run!”
- The imperative describes an action that the speaker is telling the listener to do.


* Infinitive: The infinitive is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an infinitive in English is “to run.”
- An infinitive describes an action without specifying who is doing it.


* Participle: The participle is a category of verb form in most languages.
- An example of a word in the participle is “burning” or “running.”
- Hebrew and Aramaic have two participle forms, [[the {{“active” participle}} form]], and [[the {{“passive” participle}} form]].
- Unlike words in the past or future tense which can be used alone as full sentences, participle words only form meaningful sentences when combined with other words in one of several “[[{{participle constructions}}]].”


* Participle constructions: Participle constructions are when a word in [[the {{participle}}]] is combined with other words in special combinations to express larger ideas.
- The most common “construction” is when [[a participle is combined with a noun to produce a sentence in the {{present tense}}]].
- There are participle constructions [[for describing actions in various time periods]].
- Words in the participle [[can be used as nouns]] or [[can be used as adjectives]].
- All of these rules apply to both the [[active participle]] and the [[passive participle]].

For describing actions in various time periods:
A word in the [[participle]] can be combined with other words to describe actions in different time periods.
- A word in the participle by itself technically [[has no time]].
- However, it can be used [[in the past]] or [[in the future]] using different constructions.

Has no time: A word in the participle of Hebrew or Aramaic does not alone tell us what time the action happened. This is like the English word “running,” which only describes an action, not when it happened. We require the context of the sentence to determine the time of the action.

In the past: The participle can be used in the past tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא הָיָה כּוֹתֵב (_hu haya koisev_) meaning “he used to write” or “he used to be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he wrote,” i.e. a one-time past event instead of an ongoing past event, you would just use the regular [[past tense]], and not the “past-tense construction” of the participle.

In the future: The participle can be used in the future tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא יִהְיֶה כּוֹתֵב (_hu yiyeh koisev_), meaning “he will be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he will write,” i.e. a one-time future event, you would just use the regular [[future tense]] and not the “future-tense construction” of the participle.

Can be used as nouns: The participle can be used as a noun in two ways:
- A participle [[can describe someone doing an action]].
- A participle [[can describe an instance of an action]].

Can describe someone doing an action:
The participle can represent someone doing a given action. For example:
| *General* | *Specific* |
| *רָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *a runner* needs shoes | *הַרָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ha’ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *the runner* needs shoes |
Here, we see the Hebrew word “running” can also mean “a person who is running,” and that adding a ה means “the person who is running,” a form found often in the Mishnah.

Can describe an instance of an action:
The participle can represent an instance of an action, (although this may be very uncommon.) For example:
|‎ *כּוֹתֵב* שֶׁלוֹ תַּמִיד <br><br> _*kosev* shelo tamid_ <br><br><br> his *writing* is constant | *זוֹעֵק* שֶׁלוֹ הַרְבֵּה <br><br> _*zo’eik* shelo harbe_ <br><br><br> his *yelling* is numerous |
Here, we see that the Hebrew word “writing” can be used as a noun, meaning “a particular instance of the act of writing.”

Can be used as adjectives: A participle can be used as an adjective, eg:
| Hebrew  | שִׁמְעוׄן *יָשׁוּב* |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _Shimeon *yashuv*_ |
| English | Shimeon is *seated* |
- Really, all participles are essentially adjectives, which is why they only have [[_Pa’al_ Active Participle for Regular Shorushim|four conjugations for gender and number]] as opposed to [[_Pa’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim|other tenses that have conjugations for different people]].
- I.e., in Hebrew and Aramaic, the words “tall” and “running” in the sentences “I am tall” and “I am running” are both the same type of word.


* Passive Participle: The passive participle (sometimes called the “passive participle,” or _lashon pa’ul_ or _pa’il)_ is a special type of word in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- In English, an example of a “passive” participle is the word “written,” or the word “burnt.”
- A passive participle represents the result of an action (eg “burnt”) as opposed to an ongoing action (eg “burning.”)
- Students interested in grammar can read [[additional information about the passive participle]].

Additional information about the passive participle:
Here is additional information about the passive participle:
- Finished participles are adjectives that are formed from [[simple]] verbs, for example “burnt” comes from the verb “to burn.”
- The passive participle in Hebrew looks like כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and in Aramaic like כְּתִיב (_kasiv)_.
- The passive participle only exists in certain binyanim, namely [[the Hebrew {{_pa’al_}}]] and [[the Aramaic {{pe’al}}]].
- There are [[differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim]].
- Like [[the {{active participle}}]], the passive participle only has meaning in [[one of several {{“participle constructions”}}]].

Differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim:
Many students confuse the passive participle of active binyanim like [[_pa’al_]] and [[the {{active participle}}]] of [[passive binyanim]]:
- For example, what is the difference between the [[{|active} _pa’al_ {|binyan’s} passive participle]], כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and the [[{|passive} _nif’al_ {|binyan’s} active participle]], נִכְתָּב _nichtav?_
- The [[simple]] [[passive]] binyanim i.e. [[the Hebrew {{_nif’al_}}]] and [[the Aramaic {{_ispe’el_}}]] represent an ongoing action being done to the subject e.g. “it is _being_ written” or “it is _regularly_ written upon.”
- The passive participle כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, by contrast, would mean “it is written,” without a connection to an ongoing action.


* Past tense: The past tense is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Present tense: The present tense in Hebrew and Aramaic is formed by combining a [[participle]] with a pronoun in a special [[{“participle construction”}s]]:
- The present tense is produced by taking a pronoun like הוּא (_hu_, “he”) followed by a participle like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) producing a sentence, “he is writing.”
- There is no word equivalent to “is” in Hebrew and Aramaic, so we just say “he writing” and the “is” is implied by context.
- Even though the [[active participle]] is sometimes called the “present tense” (or לְשׁוֹן הוֹוֶה _lashon hoveh)_, an active participle by itself like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) is not necessarily in the present tense, and can be used in the past or future, as in “he was writing.”
- [[The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle]].

The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle: The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” construction corresponds to multiple English verb forms:
- In English, you can say “he is writing” (English participle) or “he writes” (English present tense.)
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, both of these forms would be expressed with the same participle construction i.e. הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv_.)
- Therefore, when we see a sentence like הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv)_, we can’t be sure whether it means “he is writing” or “he writes.”
- As English has many more words than Hebrew and Aramaic, it is quite common for multiple words in English to be the same word in Hebrew or Aramaic, producing ambiguities when translating from Hebrew or Aramaic back to English.


* Verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic: There are several verb forms and tenses in Hebrew and Aramaic:
| [[Past Tense]] | [[Future Tense]] | [[{{Active Participle}}]] |
| [[Imperative]] | [[Infinitive]] | [[Passive Participle]] |


[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim]

* Hebrew binyanim: There are seven binyanim in Hebrew. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)

* Hif’il: The “Hif’il” (הִפְעִיל) is one of the [[hebrew binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- If you take a [[shoresh]] like קדש which means “holiness” and put it in the _hif’il_ binyan, it produces a verb that means “causing” something else to become holy, i.e. “donating something to the temple.”
- Advanced students can read [[more information about the _hif’il_]].

Haaras
=============================
- Mishna
  - Rosh and Rambam?
  - How mishnayos are written - what would be the implication of each permutation, bedieved, lechatchila, etc
- Gemara’s Kasha:
  - three meanings of specificity
  - which mahalach is the gemara taking in its question
  - what is the makor for this?
  - How would you learn “haish mekadesh bshlucho”?
  - Where do we see the Gemara thinks shlichus is the bigger chiddush?
  - “also” “even” “for example”
- First answer
  - where does halacha come from / what entitles him to say this answer?
  - reason for shver mishnas
  - what is the amoritic story for?
  - What mitzvah is kiddushin? machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah, the fact that R Yosef says mitzvah ie where do we find a raya to the rambam and how does the Rosh handle it? (Maybe ask “what mitzvah is it” and introduce Rosh and Rambam here.)
  - Rosh baked matzas
  - What entitles R Yosef to say he knows what Rebbe meant?
  - Are Amoriam saying mesoras or theories?
  - What about the Mishnah makes it a proof for R Yosef’s halacha?
  - who is R Yosef? Why do we listen to them?
- Amoriam
  - Who is saying this?
  - Question of what they are proving
  - line up with shitas of machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah
  - shaarei tzion inside - what entitles him to say this chiddush?
- Second answer
  - stira to mishna
  - mialas and chisronos of both answers
  - not the same distinctions & who says that is the ookimpta and why are stam cases presumed stam
  - what is an ika damri, pnei yoshua: does the first answer not know about the second answer?
  - What does the nami mean? - put in by the compiler, or spectrum of assur/mitzvah eg second Tosofos
  - Isn’t he an oness?
  - Clarify that it isn’t RYAR’s halacha, we are presuming the Tana would know you have to see the woman first etc.
  - Who is R Yehuda amar Rav? Why do we listen to them?
- Ki itmar DRav Yosef:
  - Why didn’t the gemara stop there?
  - difference between intro of R Yosef and intro of R Yehuda amar Rav, R Yosef needs a total proof, why not say “one and one”?
  - Why does R Yosef get knocked off?
  - Why didn’t we have to move R Yehuda amar Rav?
  - Is this editing a memra of R Yosef, or was there never any memra?
  - Why take the drastic step of editing R Yosef when we can make a machlochus?
  - Why not say R Yosef holds RYAR’s source is another mishna? BC there’s no reason to think every chiddush of the mishnah is unique etc.
  - Why not just make it a machlochus / standard ika damri where there are multiple conflicting girsas?
  - Maybe we are moving R Yosef to explain the bah? But we don’t see this in the shakla v’taria.
  - Why doesn’t RYAR need a source for his halacha?
  - Why the Gemara concludes R Yosef must be moved
    1. R Yosef isn’t using a lashon of machlochus, he seems to be speaking as if he is the only game in town
    2. R Yosef agrees to RYAR’s halacha in theory
    3. RYAR’s halacha would objectively fit the “bo” and so can’t be rejected out of hand as a possibility
    4. RY is definitely speaking about our mishna
    Thus, there is a stira in R Yosef
  - How can you call what she’s doing a mitzvah?
    - vies tois a mesaye
    - But if a mesaye is called a mitzvah, why isn’t a mesaye called an aviera such that the ki itmar answer doesn’t work?
- Aval
  - set up Rashi
  - chazon ish emuna bitachon

[Gemara/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a/Mishna]

* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The first Mishnah of _Perek Ha’ish Mekadesh_ appears on on Kiddushin 41a.
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
- You can see the Mishnah [[{{picture}}d here]].
- The Mishnah has [[{required context} of the Mishnah]].
- After trying to read the Mishnah as is, you can see it [[broken into separate sentences]].

Broken into separate sentences:
This is the Mishnah broken into separate sentences. Click each part to learn more:
< [[first clause|האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו.]]
< [[second clause|האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה.]]
< [[third clause|האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו.]]

Required context of the Mishnah: The Mishnah has [[required background information]], a [[position in the perek]], and relates to a particular [[topic in halacha]].

Required background information: This Mishnah presumes familiarity with the [[_halachic_ steps of marriage]], and with the [[concept of _shlichus_]].

_Halachic_ steps of marriage: In Jewish law, a state of marriage is produced by two steps, [[_kiddushin_]] and [[_nisuyin_]].

_kiddushin_: The first step of Jewish marriage is called _erusin_ or _kiddushin_. After _kiddushin_, the woman is designated to the man for marriage and would need a halachic divorce in order to remarry. However, the couple is not yet married, and may not live together or have physical contact. The first Mishnah of _Maseches Kiddushin_ discusses the different ways in which a man and woman can produce a state of _kiddushin_. _Kiddushin_ is sometimes translated as “engagement” although the binding nature of _kiddushin_ is one difference between it and ordinary engagement.

_nisuyin_: The second step of Jewish marriage is called _nisuyin_. After _kiddushin_, the couple must create a state of _nisuyin_ in order to be formally married. In the times of the Gemara _nisuyin_ might be done a year after _kiddushin_. Today, however, _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are done in the same wedding ceremony. Typically _nisuyin_ is done by having the wife enter the residence of the groom, either his actual residence, or more commonly the _chupah_ or _yichud_ room.

Concept of _shlichus_: In _halacha_, there are various actions a person can do that produce _halachic_ consequences, such as buying and selling goods, or doing a _mitzvah_ like giving _tzeddukah_. In this _perek_, we will see that some of these actions can be performed by an emissary, or _shaliach_, who is designated beforehand by the individual, and the individual is credited with the action the emissary performs. Which actions can be done via _shaliach_ and other questions regarding _shlichus_ will be the primary topic of this Mishnah and the Gemaras that discuss it.

Position in the perek: This is the first Mishnah in the second _perek_ of _Maseches Kiddushin_. The first _perek_ began by discussing the different methods a man can use to be _mekadesh_ a woman, and this Mishnah will continue to discuss related topics.

Topic in halacha: This Mishnah will discuss which aspects of the marriage process can be done via a _shaliach_. Think to yourself now, what parts would you guess can be done by _shaliach_, and which parts would you think one wouldn’t be able to do via _shaliach_?

Picture: ![Kiddushin 41a Vilna Edition](/_assets/dafim/Kiddushin_41a_mishnah.png “Kiddushin 41a” “Kiddushin 41a Vilna Romm Edition 1880-86CE, courtesy of Sefaria.org”)

First clause:
In order to understand the first clause:
- First we’ll [[prepare to read the first clause]]
- Then, we’ll [[closely read the first clause]].
- Then, we’ll [[analyze the first clause]].
- Lastly, we will learn [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Prepare to read the first clause: Before we see what the Mishnah actually says, let’s [[consider what we would think the halacha should be]].

Consider what we would think the halacha should be: The first clause of the Mishnah is discussing whether a man can create _kiddushin_ with a woman via a messenger without himself being present. Before reading on, stop and ask yourself, do you think this would work? Why or why not?

Closely read the first clause: To closely read the first clause of the Mishnah:
- Ask [[how do you know where the first clause ends?]]
- For more advanced students, understand the [[{{individual words}} of the first clause]]
- Understand a [[{{literal translation}} of the first clause]].
- Produce a [[{{summary}} of the Mishnah so far]].

How do you know where the first clause ends? How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? By reading the Mishnah, we should notices some similar-looking words being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Individual words:
Next we need to understand the individual words of the first clause, you can select one to learn more:
< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]

האיש: The word האיש has:
- [[Possible meanings of האיש]]
- A translation of האיש
- [[Actual meaning of האיש]] (Try reading the “possible meanings” of all the words in the sentence before looking at the “actual meaning” of any word, so that you can practice figuring it out yourself.)
- How you can figure it out

Possible meanings of האיש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word in this context:
- There are [[different things a ה at the start of a word could mean]].
- There are [[smaller words that might be part of האיש]].

Smaller words that might be part of האיש:
Maybe האיש is composed of smaller words:
- There is an Aramaic word הא which means “that”
- There is an Aramaic word האי which means “this”
- There is a Hebrew word אש meaning “fire”
- There is a Hebrew word איש meaning “man.”

Actual meaning of האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה meaning “the”]], and we can eliminate [[other possibilities]].

Other possibilities: We are reading a Mishnah, so we know we are reading Hebrew and not Aramaic, and so we shouldn’t think the word האיש might be related to the Aramaic words הא or האי. Nevertheless, if there would exist a [[shoresh]] spelled נאש, then the האיש could have been a past tense verb from that shoresh, (the same way נפל can become הִפִּיל), however, there is no such shoresh, so we know that can’t be the answer. (For advanced readers, this kind of verb is called a [[hifil]].)

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means “man.”

The prefix ה meaning “the”: The prefix ה in front of a noun in Hebrew is similar to the English word “the.”

מקדש: We can analyze the word מקדש in several steps:
- We can give [[hints for how to read מקדש]]
- We can produce [[a translation of מקדש]]
- We can give [[a grammatical explanation of מקדש]]
- We can review [[instructions to figure out the meaning of מקדש]]

Hints for how to read מקדש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word.
- There are [[different things a מ at the start of a word could mean]].
- There is a [[shoresh]] spelled [[קדש]] which has various meanings
- There are [[two verb forms that are spelled exactly like their shoresh]].

Two verb forms that are spelled exactly like their shoresh: A [[shoresh]] like אכל can produce multiple types of past-tense verbs, and one type would look like אָכַל, and one type would look like אִכֵּל, and because the Gemara doesn’t have vowels, if you see three shoresh letters together like אכל, you might be looking at one of these two types of past-tense verb. (For advanced readers, אָכַל is the past-tense form of a [[{{pa’al}} verb]], and אִכֵּל is the past-tense form of a [[{{pi’el}} verb]].)

A translation of מקדש:
We can give a translation of the word מקדש:
- The word מקדש here is a verb describing a man who is creating the initial stage of marriage, i.e. _kiddushin_ with a woman.
- It means “he is producing _kiddushin_,” or “he produces _kiddushin_.”

A grammatical explanation of מקדש: This is a grammatical explanation of the word מקדש:
- First, you can review [[how to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- The word מקדש is from [[the {{_pi’el_}} form {{ of }} the shoresh {{“קדש”}}]].
- The word מקדש is in the [[{{_pi’el_}}_’s_ {{ “active participle” }} form, as conjugated {{for regular shorushim}}, in the masculine singular]].

Instructions to figure out the meaning of מקדש:
These are instructions for determining the meaning of מקדש:
1. We are reading a Mishnah so we know it is Hebrew.
2. Once we know the previous word האיש is a noun, we should expect a verb.
3. מקדש has 4 [[strong letters]], so either the [[shoresh]] is מקד and there is a ש suffix, or the shoresh is קדש and there is a מ prefix.
4. There is no such suffix as ש, nor such a shoresh as מקד, so we see the shoresh is קדש and the prefix is מ.
5. There are four verb forms in Hebrew that have a מ prefix, the [[_pi’el_ active participle]], the [[_pu’al_ active participle]], the [[hif’il active participle]], and the [[huf’al active participle]].
6. Of these four, only the [[_pi’el_ active participle]] has a מ prefix and no additional letters.
7. Thus, we see מקדש is a [[{{_pi’el_ active participle for }}{regular shorushim|a regular shoresh} in the masculine singular]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning “someone who makes something holy”, a verb, someone or something “is making holy,” or an adjective, something has “the quality of making something holy.”

בו: The word בו has several [[{possible meanings} of בו]], and an [[{actual meaning} of בו]].

Possible meanings of בו:
Here are some guesses at the meaning of this word:
- A ו can sometimes make an “oh” sound, and there is a common verb in Hebrew pronounced “bo” that means “to come,” so maybe this is a conjugation of that verb.
- There is also a prefix ב that can mean “in,” “with,” “on,” “via,” or “at the time of,” and there are various suffixes you can attach to it that indicate what is being refered to (ie “on/with/via” _what?)_

Actual meaning of בו: The word בו here means “via himself,” and there is a [[{grammatical explanation} of בו]].

Grammatical explanation of בו: For those interested in grammar, בו is [[the prefix ב]] in its meaning of [[“by” or “via”]] using the [[{|masculine singular }{suffix}es]] to indicate he is doing something “via _himself_.” We know it isn’t the verb בוא meaning “comes” because even though it is pronounced the same as בו, that verb has an א in it.

ובשלוחו: The word ובשלוחו has [[{possible meanings} of the word ובשלוחו]] and an [[{actual meaning} of the word ובשלוחו]].

Possible meanings of the word ובשלוחו: To be written.

Actual meaning of the word ובשלוחו: The word ובשלוחו is formed from [[the prefix ו]], followed by [[the prefix ב]], followed by [[the word שלוח]], followed by [[the noun suffix ו]].

The prefix ו: The prefix ו usually means “and,” but can also mean “or.”

The word שלוח: The word שלוח means “someone or something that is sent.” For those interested in grammar, it is [masculine singular] of the [_pa’al_ passive participle tense of the shoresh שלח].

The noun suffix ו: The suffix ו when applied to a noun means “of him” or “of it.”

- The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]]. Try to figure out the meaning of the sentence from the definitions of the individual words.

Literal translation: Once we know what all the individual words mean, we can produce a literal translation:
> The man is _mekadesh_, via himself or via his messenger.

Summary: Synthesize context and content into a summary, and see eg does the content and the context fit, is this an answer, etc. - With questions and mehalchim.

Analyze the first clause:
In order to analyze the first clause, we will consider:
- [[Comprehension questions on the first clause]]
- [[Commentators on the first clause]]

Comprehension questions on the first clause: There are observations we can make on the first clause. First, [[that it says “bo u’b’shlucho”]].

That it says “bo u’b’shlucho”: In order to understand what is interesting about this wording, let’s observe that there are [[several things you can mean when giving examples]], and then ask [[whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by “bo u’b’shlucho”]].

Several things you can mean when giving examples: If I tell you “you’re invited to come drive to my wedding,” I might mean one of three things:
- A diyuk: I am telling you that you are only invited to come to my wedding if you come by car.
- Lav davka: I am giving an example of how you could come, but what I mean is that any way is fine
- Biggest chiddush: I am telling you that you can come any way, _even_ driving, implying that for some reason it is more surprising that you’d be allowed to drive than other examples, and that all the more so it is also fine to use less-surprising forms of transportation.

Whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by “bo u’b’shlucho”: When the Mishnah gives an example of how something is done, does it generally mean for you to understand it as a diyuk, a lav-davka example, or as the biggest chiddush, and all the more so the din applies to less surprising cases?

Commentators on the first clause:
There are commentators who discuss the first clause:
- [[Rashi on Kiddushin 41a _ha’ish mekadesh bo u’b’shlucho_]]

Literal translation of the first clause: A literal translation of the first clause of the Mishnah might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does “being mekadesh” mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does “being mekadesh” mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a “present tense” statement means a psak, and so “the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary” in this context means “the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary.”

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say “any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods,” why did it say “_the_ man can be mekadesh”, as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying “_a_ man can be mekadesh,” ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek’s first sugya, [[hashta b’shlucho mekadesh bo meboy]].

Second clause:
This is the second clause of the Mishnah:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
It has context, content, and commentary.

Third clause:
This is the third clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
It has context, content, and commentary.

[Gur Aryeh]

- Question on Rashi, seems random
- It is a rule
- Why two answers?
- First answer has a better rule, second answer has a better timeline
- How can you say the first answer has a better rule when the Gur Aryeh uses the same lashon to describe the certainty of both rules?
- You can only know what a person is saying based on who they are speaking to, and what they are trying to exclude
- Who is the Gur Aryeh speaking to? Someone who disagrees with the rule? That assumes the audience has already read the Gur Aryeh.
- And, he offers no arguments.
- Also, the gur aryeh is here to explain Rashi, not to tell us his opinion, or debate with people who disagree, so it is unlikely that’s what he’s doing.
- Clearly he is speaking to someone who doesn’t have any idea there is a rule, and is coming to say “Rashi is coming from a rule”
- In which case, the fact he uses the same lashon for both rules doesn’t mean he thinks they’re equally good, and so he can agree to our pros/cons
- Gur Aryeh might even be warning us about the requirements of both answers
- Rashi thinks there is a chisaron with each answer, but the answers themselves are absolutist, and Gur Aryeh is telling us that the first answer holds the rule to be absolute, ie the Gur Aryeh’s strong lashon is to communicate the strength with which the first answer would have to hold what it holds for it to work as an answer

[Lashonos/Fixes]

* Different things a ה at the start of a word could mean:
A word beginning with ה could be:
- a name or proper noun beginning with ה, eg הוֹשֵׁעַ (_Hoshea)_

- a noun starting with [[the Hebrew version of the word “the”]]
- a [[past-tense verb that begins with ה]]
- an [[imperative verb that begin with ה]]

A word formed from a shoresh beginning with ה: A ה might be part of a word formed from a [[shoresh]] beginning with ה.
- For example, the shoresh הלך begins with ה
- The shoresh הלך produces nouns like הֲלִיכָה (_halicha_, the activity of walking)
- The shoresh הלך produces verbs like הוֹלֵךְ (_holech_, [he is] walking).

The Hebrew version of the word “the”: A ה at the start of a word might be the Hebrew version of the word “the”.
- For example הַאֶבֶן, “the rock,” formed from the word אֶבֶן, meaning “rock.”

Past-tense verb that begins with ה:
There are two kinds of [[past tense]] verb that begin with ה:
- A [[shoresh]] like אכל can produce a verb that looks like הֶאֱכִיל with a י between the second and third letters. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_hif’il_]]).
- A shoresh like לבש can produce a verb that looks like הִתְלַבֵּשׁ with a ת after the ה as the second letter. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_his’pael_]] verb).

Imperative verb that begin with ה:
There are two kinds of [[{{imperative}} (“command”)]] verb that begin with ה:
- A shoresh like אכל can produce a verb that looks like הֶאֱכִיל with a י between the second and third letters. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_hif’il_]]).

* Hebrew definite article:


[Lashonos/Grammar]

* Hebrew nouns: Hebrew has various types of nouns. Hebrew nouns [[by default have an indefinite article]], or they can have a hay ha’yedia, which is the definite article.

By default have an indefinite article: The Hebrew word איש, for example, means “a man”, not just “man” and there is no specific word in Hebrew for “a”.


[Lashonos/Nouns]

* Hebrew noun patterns: Hebrew has several noun patterns, which are letter and vowel templates that accept shorushim to produce nouns. Nouns formed from a certain pattern often have a similar meaning relative to the shoresh. Noun patterns [[have a naming convention]]. These are some of the noun patterns in Hebrew:
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pa’al_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pi’el_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hif’il_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hispa’el_ verbs]]

Have a naming convention: Noun patterns are named by putting the shoresh קטל into the given pattern, the same way that binyan names are formed by putting the shoresh פעל into the third-person masculine past-tense form of that binyan.


* Noun Patterns: There are [[Hebrew noun patterns]] and Aramaic noun patterns.


* Noun patterns that come from _Hif’il_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hif’il_]] verbs include:
- [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _taktil_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Hispa’el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hispa’el_]] verbs include:
- [[The _hiskattlut_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pa’al_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pa’al_]] verbs include:
- [[the _ktila_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pi’el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pi’el_]] verbs include:
- [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]]


* Relationship between nouns in the _hektel_ noun pattern and the _haktala_ noun pattern:
There is a standard difference between nouns in [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]] and [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]:
| *_Shoresh_* | *_Hif’il_ verb* | *_Hektel_ noun* | *_Haktala_ noun* |
|-|-|-|-|
| בדל <br> seperation | הִבְדִיל <br><br> _hivdil_ <br><br><br> he seperated | הֶבְדֵּל <br><br> _hevdel_ <br><br><br> a difference / seperation | הַבְדָּלָה <br><br> _havdalah_ <br><br><br> an act of seperation |
| קדש <br> holiness | הִקְדִּישׁ <br><br> _hikdish_ <br><br><br> he donated to the temple | הֶקְדֵּשׁ <br><br> _hekdesh_ <br><br><br> property of the temple |  הַקְדָּשָׁה <br><br> _hakdasha_ <br><br><br> an act of donation <br> to the temple |
| קשר <br> connection | הִקְשִׁיר <br><br> _hikshir_ <br><br><br> he connected | הֶקְשֵׁר <br><br> _heksher_ <br><br><br> a connection | הַקְשָׁרָה <br><br> _hakshara_ <br><br><br> an act of connecting |
As you can see, the _hif’il_ verb represents an action, the _haktala_ noun represents an instance of that action, and the _hektel_ noun will represent the _result_ of that action. Not every _hif’il_ verb however will have both a _hektel_ and a _haktala_ form. For a full list of _hektel-haktala_ word pairs, see [Klein on _havdalah_](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B8%D7%94.1).

[Lashonos/Shoresh]

* Four-letter shorushim: While most shorushim have three letters, sometimes we see shorushim that seem to have four distinct letters.
- For example: שבעד, meaning “subjugation,” or טלטל meaning “movement.”
- These four-letter shorushim [[can only have verb forms in certain binyanim]].
- Four letter shorushim are often special forms of normal shorushim, like the [[_shaf’el_]] and the [[_pilpul_]] forms, although [[some seem to have intrinsic meanings]].

Can only have verb forms in certain binyanim:
Four-letter shorushim can only have verb forms in [[{{binyan}}im]] with a doubled middle letter, like the [[_pi’el_]].
- This is because the doubled letter creates room for the four consonant sounds of the shoresh:
| *Shoresh* | *[[_Pi’el_]] example* | *Notes*|
| דבר <br> speech | מְדַ*בֵּ*ר <br><br> _meda*b*’*b*er_ <br><br><br> he is saying | - This is a regular three-letter shoresh. <br> - The middle בּ (“b”) is said twice <br> - I.e. both “middle slots” are used for בּ |
| שׁחרר <br> liberation | מְשַׁ*חְרֵ*ר <br><br> _mesha*ch*’*r*eir_ <br><br><br> he is liberating | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ח (“ch”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ר (“r”)|
| טלטל <br> movement | מְטַ*לְטֵ*ל <br><br> _meta*l’t*el_ <br><br><br> he is moving | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ל (“l”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ט (“t”) |
- A verb form without a doubled middle letter, like כּוֹתֵב (_kosev_, “writing”), wouldn’t have room to accomidate the four consonants of a four-letter shoresh. (For advanced students, כּוֹתֵב is an example of a form called the [[_pa’al_ active participle]].)

Some seem to have intrinsic meanings: Some four letter shorushim seem to be intrinsically meaningful and are not related to other shorushim. For example:
- פרנס, “livelihood,” used in verbs like לְפַרְנֵס _lefarneis_ “to support financially.”
- קטרג, “accusation,” used in verbs like לְקַטְרֵג _lekatreig_, “to accuse”


* Irregular shorushim: An irregular shoresh, as opposed to a [[regular shor{ushim|esh}]], is a [[shoresh]] that has special letters that affect the vowelization of verbs produced from it. Here are some examples of irregular shorushim and their irregular verb conjugations:
| *Shoresh* | *Irregularity* | *Expected <br> Conjugation* | * Real <br> Conjugation* | *Comment* |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ישב | י in first position | מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_ | מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ | י changes to וֹ |
| נפל | נ in the first position | מַנְפִּיל (_manpil)_ | מַפִּיל (_map’pil)_ | נ drops, and the פ is doubled |
| בנה | ה in the last position | בָּנַהְתִּי  (_baunah’ti)_ | בָּנִיתִי (_bauniti)_ | the consonant ה becomes an יִ vowel, like “bee” |
There is a [[special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim]].

Special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim: We use the traditional [[shoresh letter numbering convention]] to produce an [[irregular shoresh naming convention]].

Shoresh letter numbering convention:
In Hebrew grammar, the shoresh פעל is used as a “standard” shoresh, and so sometimes the letters of פעל are used as names for the three shoresh positions:
| פ | ע | ל |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 For example, instead of saying “the first letter of the shoresh נפל,” you might say “the פ of the shoresh נפל.”

Irregular shoresh naming convention:
Because we use the letters פעל as names for the positions in a shoresh, if we want to say “the category of shorushim that have a י in the first position,” the name would be “י״פ verbs” (_yud-pay verbs_.)

A common example is a shoresh that has a י in the first position, such as ישב, where the י will often becomes a ו in verb forms that have prefixes, for example having מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ instead of the more typical מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_, which might be harder to pronounce.


* Pilpul: The _pilpul_ is a form where a weak shoresh with only two strong letters (eg טול) or a shoresh with a repeated second letter (eg לחח) has the first and last letters doubled to produce a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| טול | to move | טלטל | to teeter about |
| לחח | to be moist | לחלח | to moisten |
| בלל | to mix | בלבל | to confuse |
| משׁשׁ | to touch | משׁמשׁ | to examine physically |
The meaning of the _pilpul_ form is often a more repetitive version of the meaning of the two-letter form. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _pilpul_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Regular shorushim: A regular [[shoresh]] is a shoresh where the vowels and spelling of verbs that are produced from that shoresh follow the normal patterns for each verb form. This is as opposed to [[irregular shorushim]].


* Shaf’el: The _shaf’el_ form is a special type of [[four-letter shor{ushim|esh}]].
- It is produced by taking a shoresh like עבד and adding a ש to the front to produce a new shoresh like שעבד.
- A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf’el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]
- A shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf’el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Notes* |
| עבד <br> work | שעבד <br> subjugate <br> (to make someone else work) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| זרע <br> seeding | שזרע <br> reseeding (causing to become seeded) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| נוע <br> moving | שנע <br> transporting (causing to move) | This is a “weak” shoresh with only two strong letters, and it becomes a three letter shoresh |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf’el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Shoresh: Shoresh is a grammatical entity in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- An example of a shoresh is “א-כ-ל,” which represents the idea of “eating.”
- A shoresh is used to produce many related words, like אוֹכֶל, which means “food,” or אֲכִילָה, which means “the act of eating.”
- The shoresh is just a series of letters and is not itself a word, and has no vowels or pronunciation.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the concept of shoresh]].

Learn more about the concept of shoresh:
This is additional information on the concept of shoresh:
- A shoresh is a series of letters that represents a wide range of meaning, <br> like אכל (eating) שלח (sending) or ראה (sight)
- The word “shoresh” [[means root]] because shorushim are [[used to produce words]].
- Shorushim [[generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters]].
- There are [[regular shorushim]] and [[irregular shorushim]].

Means root:
The word shoresh can mean “root” or “source.”
- In this context, it means “root” in the sense that a words like “memory” and “memorize” come from the same linguistic root “mem.”

Generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters:
Shorushim generally have three letters. However:
- Some shorushim, [[appear to have two letters]].
- Some shorushim have [[Four-letter shorushim|have four letters]].

Appear to have two letters: Sometimes, we find words that only appear to have two recognizable letters, like מֵת, (_meis_, “he is dying.”)
- Some consider the word מֵת to come from a two-letter shoresh “מת”
- Some consider מֵת to come from a shoresh “מות,” whose “weak middle letter” gets hidden in certain conjugations. (Examples of “weak” letters are י,‎ ו and ה.)
- Either way, it is just a disagreement about what to call things, not over the spelling of any actual word.
- This site generally uses three letter shorushim like “מות” to keep things consistent, but either system is correct.

Corollaries in English: In English, you often have a linguistic root like “mem” which is used to produce a series of related words like “memory,” “memorize,” or “memorable.” Shorushim are a similar concept, except they are a bit more formal than in English, because there are fixed rules for how many letters they can be, and how they get turned into words.

Used to produce words: A shoresh is called a “root” because many words derive from one shoresh.
- A shoresh has a general meaning is used to generate many words with more specific meanings.
- For example, the shoresh אכל “eating” can be plugged into a particular verb pattern to generate the verb לְהַאֲכִיל, _leha’achil_, “to feed.”
- (For advanced readers, these patterns are called [[{{binyan}}im]], and לְהַאֲכִיל comes from the [[{{“hif’il”}} binyan]].)

Debate over the exact definition of a shoresh: Often we see words that only seem to have two root letters, like מת, and there is a debate over whether to think of these as being a special type of “two letter” shoresh, or whether to think of them as being a three-letter shoresh like מות that loses the middle letter in certain conjugations, but this dispute has no practical ramifications because everyone agrees on the spelling of the words that come from two-letter shorushim.

[Lashonos/Terms]

* “Hashta”: “Hashta” (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning “now,” but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to “_now_ that you’ve told me X, how can the text say Y?”


* “Lishna”: [[What is the literal definition of “lishna”?]] [[What does “lishna” mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of “lishna”? “Lishna” (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means “tounge” or “language”, like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does “lishna” mean when speaking about Gemara? The word “lishna” is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the “first lishna” began, ie what portion of the text the “ika d’amri” is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the “lishna kama” (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the “lishna basra” (לשנא בשרא) ie the “later version,” which is also sometimes called “the ika d’amri” (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d’amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].
