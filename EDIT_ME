[Lashonos/Expressions]

* Ika d'amri: The phrase "ika d'amri" (איכא דאמי) is an Aramaic phrase used in Gemara, literally meaning "there are those who say." Ika d'amri is used by the Gemara to introduce multiple versions of a section of Gemara, which are sometimes called [["Lishna"|lishnas]].


[Lashonos/Grammar]

* Hebrew nouns: Hebrew has various types of nouns. Hebrew nouns [[by default have an indefinite article]], or they can have a hay ha'yedia, which is the definite article.

By default have an indefinite article: The Hebrew word איש, for example, means "a man", not just "man" and there is no specific word in Hebrew for "a".


[Lashonos/Shorushim]

* The shoresh בעה: "בעה" is a shoresh in Aramaic that can mean "requesting", "searching" or "needing".


* The shoresh קדש: "קדש" is a shoresh in Hebrew and Aramaic that has various meanings that involve the concept of "holiness." It has simple, [[intensive]], causative, and reflexive forms.

Intensive: The intensive form of the shoresh קדש appears in both Hebrew and Aramaic. There is a [[meaning of the intensive]], and there are [[forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic: There are [[forms of the intensive of in Hebrew]] and forms of the intensive in Aramaic.

Forms of the intensive of in Hebrew: There is an intensive past tense, a [[Hebrew intensive participial tense]], an intensive future tense, an intensive command tense, and an intensive infinitive tense.

Hebrew intensive participial tense: There is a [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]], a Hebrew feminine singular participial, a Hebrew masculine plural participial, and a Hebrew feminine plural participial.

Hebrew masculine singular participial: The Hebrew masculine singular participial of the shoresh "קדש" is מְקַדֵּשׁ, pronounced "mekadesh."

Meaning of the intensive: It means "to produce a stage called _kiddushin_ between a man and a woman." Kiddushin is a stage prior to full marriage (called nisuyin) in which the woman is halachically designated to the man.


[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].


[Talmud Bavli]

* Talmud Bavli: The Talmud Bavli is a commentary on the Mishnah. Talmud Bavli [[follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah]].

Follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah: There is Talmud Bavli on Seder Moed, [[Seder Nashim]], Seder Nezikin, Seder Kodashim, and Seder Tahoros.

Seder Nashim: Seder Nashim of Talmud Bavli includes Yevamot, Ketubot, Nedarim, Nazir, Sotah, Gittin, and [[Maseches Kiddushin|Kiddushin]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin]

* Maseches Kiddushin: Maseches Kiddushin is a masechta of [[Seder Nashim]] in [[Talmud Bavli]]. It has several [[perakim]].

Perakim: The first perek of Meseches Kiddushin is Perek Ha'isha Niknas. The second perek of Maseches Kiddushin is [[Perek Ha'Ish Mekadesh]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a]

* Kiddushin 41a: Kiddushin 41a is an amud from [[Maseches Kiddushin]], and is the first amud of [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]]. It contains [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]], and the sugya of [["hashta b'shlucho mekadesh"]].


* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a. It has a [[first clause]], a [[second clause]], and a [[third clause]].

First clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
This is the first clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the first clause]], a [[literal translation of the first clause]], and a [[pshat in the first clause]]. The first clause is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [["hashta b'shlucho mekadesh"|"hashta b'shlucho mekadesh."]]

Words of the first clause: The first clause includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]].

The word האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה]].

The word איש: This is the noun "man".

The prefix ה: This is the word "the".

The word מקדש: מקדש ("mekadesh") is the [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]] of [[the shoresh קדש]].

The word בו: This is the prefix ב with a third-person masculine conjugation.

The word ובשלוחו: This is the prefix ו, followed by the prefix ב, followed by the word שלוח, followed by the suffix ו.

Literal translation of the first clause: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal translation might be:
> The man is being mekadesh, with himself or with an emissary
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does האיש begin with ה?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does האיש begin with ה? [[It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a ה-prefix]], but [[perhaps the Mishnah uses a ה-prefix because of the Mishnah it is following]].

It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a ה-prefix: If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Perhaps the Mishnah uses a ה-prefix because of the Mishnah it is following: Perhaps we can say that this Mishnah is following the first Mishnah of the masechta, which spoke about ways "the woman" is niknas, and so maybe the "the" in "the woman" and the "the" in "the man" are being used to exclude one another - "_the_ woman" (as opposed to the man in the interaction,) and "_the_ man" (as opposed to the woman in the interaction.)

Pshat in the first clause: A pshat in the first clause of the Mishna might be:
> A man is allowed to be mekadesh an isha, himself or with a shaliach

Second clause:
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the second clause]], a [[literal translation of the second clause]], and a [[pshat in the second clause]].

Words of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the second clause: This is a work in progress.


Third clause:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the third clause]], a [[literal translation of the third clause]], and a [[pshat in the third clause]].

Words of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the third clause: This is a work in progress.


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Perakim/Ha'ish Mekadesh]

* Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh: The sugyos of Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh can be accessed [[by mishnah]], or [[by daf]]. Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh is the second perek of [[Maseches Kiddushin]].

By daf: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh covers eighteen dafim, beginning on [[Kiddushin 41a]] and ending on Kiddushin 58b.

By Mishnah: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh begins with [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Sugyos]

* "Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh":
The full text of the sugya "hashta b'shlucho mekadesh" reads:
< גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא
< איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
< כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
< אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
< עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
< ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
< כמוך וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
< בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
< מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
< מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
< איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
< למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו:
You can learn the sugya's various [[parts]], and can review with an outside [[summary]]. This sugya discusses the [[first clause]] of [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]], and is the first sugya in [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]] appearing on [[Kiddushin 41a]].

Parts: The sugya of "hashta b'shlucho mekadesh" begins with [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]], and is followed by the section [[amar R Yosef]] and then by [[the ika d'amri]], followed by [[v'chi itmar d'Rav Yosef]], and finally by [[aval b'ha isura leis ba]]. Once the parts are clear we can [[compare R Yosef and the ika d'amri]].

Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya:
< גמ' *השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא* אמר
The sugya of "hashta b'shlucho mekadesh" begins with the sentence above. You can learn [[how to know the sentence השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא ends here|how to know the sentence ends here]]. You can review [[where we're holding before השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא|where we're holding]], and learn [[background information that might be necessary to understand the Gemara's next step]], so that we can [[speculate about what sort of thing the Gemara might be doing with השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא|speculate about what the Gemara might be doing next]]. You can read about the [[words of "hashta b'shlucho mekadesh"]], a [[literal translation of the opening kasha]], a [[pshat in the opening kasha]], and hear [[ha'aras on the opening kasha]].

How to know the sentence השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא ends here: How do we know that "השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא" is one sentence, ending with the word "מיבעיא"? Because words after "השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא" are אמר ר' יוסף, "amar Rav Yosef", ie "says Rav Yosef", we see that the Gemara is introducing an opinion of R Yosef, and so by implication the Gemara's first sentence ended before the word אמר.

Where we're holding before השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא: This sentence in the Gemara is discussing the [[first clause]] of [[the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]], so review that Mishnah and try to guess what the Gemara might be saying about it here.

Background information that might be necessary to understand the Gemara's next step: It might be helpful to know that the Gemara seems to assume that Mishnayos are teaching the "biggest chiddush," ie, if a Mishnah says it is assur to steal $10, that implies that it is not assur to steal less, otherwise it would have said that instead. See how this principle applies to the [[first clause]] of [[the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]].

Speculate about what sort of thing the Gemara might be doing with השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא: Given that there is a question on the Mishnah, it might make sense for the first sentence of the Gemara to be asking a question about it.

Words of "hashta b'shlucho mekadesh":
The text of the opening kasha is composed of the word [["hashta"]], [[the word "b'shlucho"]], [[the word "mekadesh"]], [[the word "bo"]], and [[the word "meboya"]].

The word "b'shlucho": This is a work in progress.

The word "mekadesh": This is a work in progress.

The word "bo": This is a work in progress.

The word "meboya": This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the opening kasha: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal (but unclear) translation of the opening kasha would be:
> "Now that with his agent he is mekadesh, with himself is needed."
Try to figure out what this might mean, then you can ask the following questions: [[What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here?]] [[What does 'with himself' mean here?]] [[What does "is needed" mean here?]]

What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here? You might wonder what the words "with his agent he is mekadesh" (בשלוחו מקדש) mean. They are a reference to the Mishnah, which said that a man can be mekadesh with his agent.

What does 'with himself' mean here? You might ask what does the word "with himself" (בו) means in the sentence "with himself is needed". "With himself" is a quotation from the Mishnah, and so the subject of the sentence is the word "בו", and the literal translation of the Gemara is that it is saying "the word בו in the Mishnah is needed".

What does "is needed" mean here? The Gemara uses the phrase "is needed" (מיבעיא), from [[the shoresh בעה]], to speak about words in the Mishnah and to speak about why each one is necessary.

Pshat in the opening kasha: The opening kasha seems to be asking: now that the Mishnah has taught us that a man can be mekadesh via his agent, then I already know by implication that the lesser chiddush that he can be mekadesh himself is true, so why did the Mishnah have to teach it to me?

Ha'aras on the opening kasha: From the opening kasha, we see certain assumptions the Gemara is making about the Mishnah.

Amar R Yosef:
< [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא
The first lishna is an answer to the Gemara's kasha, quoted below. The first lishna is composed of the [[amira of R Yosef]] and [[ha d'Rav Safra]].

Amira of R Yosef:
< [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו [כי הא דרב]
The amira of R Yosef follows the Gemara's kasha and is the first portion of the first lishna, quoted below.

Ha d'Rav Safra:
< כי הא דרב [רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו]
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא
The section "ha d'Rav Safra" follows the amira of R Yosef, quoted below. You can read about the [[words of ha d'Rav Safra]]

Words of ha d'Rav Safra: The section "ha d'Rav Safra" includes the word ki, the word ha, the phrase d'Rav Safra, the word machrich, the word reisha, the word Rava, the word malach, and the word shibuta.

The ika d'amri:
< איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
< כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
< אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
< עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
< ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
< כמוך

The ika d'amri and discussion includes a [[second lishna]] and the Gemara's [[discussion of the second lishna]].

V'chi itmar d'Rav Yosef:
< וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
< בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
< מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
< מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא

Aval b'ha isura leis ba:
< אבל בהא
< איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
< למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו

Second lishna:
< איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
< כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
< אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
< עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
< ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
< כמוך
This is the Gemara's second lishna.

Discussion of the second lishna:
< וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
< בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
< מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
< מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
< איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
< למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו
This is the Gemara's discussion of the second lishna, and is composed of

Compare R Yosef and the ika d'amri: This is a work in progress.
