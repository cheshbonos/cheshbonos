[Cheshbonos]

** Cheshbonos: This is an early beta version of Cheshbonos, a tool for improving Gemara skills. You can navigate by using the mouse or arrow keys. You can use Cheshbonos to learn [[Kiddushin 41a]]. If you are new to Gemara, you can use the [[{{getting started}} guide]]. You can also [[learn more about the project]].

Learn more about the project: Cheshbonos has a [[dedication]]. Cheshbonos is published with various [[disclaimers]]. You can post your questions or comments on the [issues page](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/issues). You can sign up for occasional [[email updates]]. You can download the Cheshbonos [desktop app](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/releases/tag/latest). Cheshbonos is built using [Canopy.js](https://github.com/canopy-js/canopy-js).

Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such people should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for individuals who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning. Cheshbonos can be downloaded and used without an internet connection, and the existence of a web interface does not represent an endorsement of internet use.

Haaras
=============================
- Mishna
  - Rosh and Rambam?
  - How mishnayos are written - what would be the implication of each permutation, bedieved, lechatchila, etc
- Gemara's Kasha:
  - three meanings of specificity
  - which mahalach is the gemara taking in its question
  - what is the makor for this?
  - How would you learn "haish mekadesh bshlucho"?
  - Where do we see the Gemara thinks shlichus is the bigger chiddush?
  - "also" "even" "for example"
- First answer
  - where does halacha come from / what entitles him to say this answer?
  - reason for shver mishnas
  - what is the amoritic story for?
  - What mitzvah is kiddushin? machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah, the fact that R Yosef says mitzvah ie where do we find a raya to the rambam and how does the Rosh handle it? (Maybe ask "what mitzvah is it" and introduce Rosh and Rambam here.)
  - Rosh baked matzas
  - What entitles R Yosef to say he knows what Rebbe meant?
  - Are Amoriam saying mesoras or theories?
  - What about the Mishnah makes it a proof for R Yosef's halacha?
  - who is R Yosef? Why do we listen to them?
- Amoriam
  - Who is saying this?
  - Question of what they are proving
  - line up with shitas of machlochus is kiddushin a mitzvah
  - shaarei tzion inside - what entitles him to say this chiddush?
- Second answer
  - stira to mishna
  - mialas and chisronos of both answers
  - not the same distinctions & who says that is the ookimpta and why are stam cases presumed stam
  - what is an ika damri, pnei yoshua: does the first answer not know about the second answer?
  - What does the nami mean? - put in by the compiler, or spectrum of assur/mitzvah eg second Tosofos
  - Isn't he an oness?
  - Clarify that it isn't RYAR's halacha, we are presuming the Tana would know you have to see the woman first etc.
  - Who is R Yehuda amar Rav? Why do we listen to them?
- Ki itmar DRav Yosef:
  - Why didn't the gemara stop there?
  - difference between intro of R Yosef and intro of R Yehuda amar Rav, R Yosef needs a total proof, why not say "one and one"?
  - Why didn't we have to move R Yehuda amar Rav?
  - Is this editing a memra of R Yosef, or was there never any memra?
  - Why does R Yosef get knocked off?
  - Why not just make it a machlochus / standard ika damri where there are multiple conflicting girsas?
  - Maybe we are moving R Yosef to explain the bah? But we don't see this in the shakla v'taria.
  - Why doesn't RYAR need a source for his halacha?
  - Why the Gemara concludes R Yosef must be moved
    1. R Yosef isn't using a lashon of machlochus, he seems to be speaking as if he is the only game in town
    2. R Yosef agrees to RYAR's halacha in theory
    3. RYAR's halacha would objectively fit the "bo" and so can't be rejected out of hand as a possibility
    4. RY is definitely speaking about our mishna
    Thus, there is a stira in R Yosef
  - How can you call what she's doing a mitzvah?
    - vies tois a mesaye
    - But if a mesaye is called a mitzvah, why isn't a mesaye called an aviera such that the ki itmar answer doesn't work?
- Aval
  - set up Rashi
  - chazon ish emuna bitachon

[Gemara/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a/Mishna]

* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The first Mishnah of Perek Haish Mekadesh (found on Kiddushin 41a) is [[{{picture}}d here]].
- The Mishnah as a whole has [[{required context} of the Mishnah]].
- You can try to read the Mishna as it appears in the Gemara yourself below, or see it [[broken into separate sentences]].
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Broken into separate sentences:
This is the Mishnah broken into separate sentences. Click each part to learn more:
< [[first clause|האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו.]]
< [[second clause|האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה.]]
< [[third clause|האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו.]]

Required context of the Mishnah: The Mishnah has [[required background information]], a [[position in the perek]], and relates to a particular [[topic in halacha]].

Required background information: This Mishnah presumes familiarity with the [[_halachic_ steps of marriage]], and with the [[concept of _shlichus_]].

_Halachic_ steps of marriage: In Jewish law, a state of marriage is produced by two steps, [[_kiddushin_]] and [[_nisuyin_]].

_kiddushin_: The first step of Jewish marriage is called _erusin_ or _kiddushin_. After _kiddushin_, the woman is designated to the man for marriage and would need a halachic divorce in order to remarry. However, the couple is not yet married, and may not live together or have physical contact. The first Mishnah of _Maseches Kiddushin_ discusses the different ways in which a man and woman can produce a state of _kiddushin_. _Kiddushin_ is sometimes translated as "engagement" although the binding nature of _kiddushin_ is one difference between it and ordinary engagement.

_nisuyin_: The second step of Jewish marriage is called _nisuyin_. After _kiddushin_, the couple must create a state of _nisuyin_ in order to be formally married. In the times of the Gemara _nisuyin_ might be done a year after _kiddushin_. Today, however, _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are done in the same wedding ceremony. Typically _nisuyin_ is done by having the wife enter the residence of the groom, either his actual residence, or more commonly the _chupah_ or _yichud_ room.

Concept of _shlichus_: In _halacha_, there are various actions a person can do that produce _halachic_ consequences, such as buying and selling goods, or doing a _mitzvah_ like giving _tzeddukah_. In this _perek_, we will see that some of these actions can be performed by an emissary, or _shaliach_, who is designated beforehand by the individual, and the individual is credited with the action the emissary performs. Which actions can be done via _shaliach_ and other questions regarding _shlichus_ will be the primary topic of this Mishnah and the Gemaras that discuss it.

Position in the perek: This is the first Mishnah in the second _perek_ of _Maseches Kiddushin_. The first _perek_ began by discussing the different methods a man can use to be _mekadesh_ a woman, and this Mishnah will continue to discuss related topics.

Topic in halacha: This Mishnah will discuss which aspects of the marriage process can be done via a _shaliach_. Think to yourself now, what parts would you guess can be done by _shaliach_, and which parts would you think one wouldn't be able to do via _shaliach_?

Picture: ![Kiddushin 41a Vilna Edition](/_assets/dafim/Kiddushin_41a_mishnah.png "Kiddushin 41a" "Kiddushin 41a Vilna Romm Edition 1880-86CE, courtesy of Sefaria.org")

First clause:
In order to understand the first clause:
- First we'll [[prepare to read the first clause]]
- Then, we'll [[closely read the first clause]].
- Then, we'll [[analyze the first clause]].

Prepare to read the first clause: Before we see what the Mishnah actually says, let's [[consider what we would think the halacha should be]].

Consider what we would think the halacha should be: The first clause of the Mishnah is discussing whether a man can create _kiddushin_ with a woman via a messenger without himself being present. Before reading on, stop and ask yourself, do you think this would work? Why or why not?

Closely read the first clause: To closely read the first clause of the Mishna:
- Ask [[how do you know where the first clause ends?]]
- Understand the [[individual words]]
- Write a [[literal translation]]
- Produce a [[contextual summary]].

How do you know where the first clause ends? How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? By reading the Mishnah, we should notices some similar-looking words being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Individual words:
Next we need to understand the individual words of the first clause, you can select one to learn more:
< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]

האיש: The word האיש has [[{possible meanings} of האיש]] and an [[{actual meaning} of האיש]]. (Try reading the "possible meanings" of all the words in the sentence before looking at the "actual meaning" of any word, so that you can practice figuring it out yourself.)

Possible meanings of האיש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word in this context:
- There are [[different things a ה at the start of a word could mean]].
- There are [[smaller words that might be part of האיש]].

Smaller words that might be part of האיש:
Maybe האיש is composed of smaller words:
- There is an Aramaic word הא which means "that"
- There is an Aramaic word האי which means "this"
- There is a Hebrew word אש meaning "fire"
- There is a Hebrew word איש meaning "man."

Actual meaning of האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה meaning "the"]], and we can eliminate [[other possibilities]].

Other possibilities: We are reading a Mishnah, so we know we are reading Hebrew and not Aramaic, and so we shouldn't think the word האיש might be related to the Aramaic words הא or האי. Nevertheless, if there would exist a [[shoresh]] spelled נאש, then the האיש could have been a past tense verb from that shoresh, (the same way נפל can become הִפִּיל), however, there is no such shoresh, so we know that can't be the answer. (For advanced readers, this kind of verb is called a [[hifil]].)

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means "man."

The prefix ה meaning "the": The prefix ה in front of a noun in Hebrew is similar to the English word "the."

מקדש: The word מקדש has [[{possible meanings} of מקדש]], an [[{actual meaning} of מקדש]] and a [[{grammatical explanation} of מקדש]].

Possible meanings of מקדש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word. There are [[different things a מ at the start of a word could mean]]. There is a [[shoresh]] spelled [[קדש]] which has various meanings, and there [[two verb forms that are spelled exactly like their shoresh]].

Two verb forms that are spelled exactly like their shoresh: A [[shoresh]] like אכל can produce multiple types of past-tense verbs, and one type would look like אָכַל, and one type would look like אִכֵּל, and because the Gemara doesn't have vowels, if you see three shoresh letters together like אכל, you might be looking at one of these two types of past-tense verb. (For advanced readers, אָכַל is the past-tense form of a [[{{pa'al}} verb]], and אִכֵּל is the past-tense form of a [[{{pi'el}} verb]].)

Actual meaning of מקדש: The word מקדש here means for a man to create a status of _kedushin_ with a woman prior to marriage.

Grammatical explanation of מקדש: For those interested in grammar, the word מקדש is the the [[pi'el participle]] of [[the shoresh {{קדש}}]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning "someone who makes something holy", a verb, someone or something "is making holy," or an adjective, something has "the quality of making something holy."

בו: The word בו has several [[{possible meanings} of בו]], and an [[{actual meaning} of בו]].

Possible meanings of בו:
Here are some guesses at the meaning of this word:
- A ו can sometimes make an "oh" sound, and there is a common verb in Hebrew pronounced "bo" that means "to come," so maybe this is a conjugation of that verb.
- There is also a prefix ב that can mean "in," "with," "on," "via," or "at the time of," and there are various suffixes you can attach to it that indicate what is being refered to (ie "on/with/via" _what?_)

Actual meaning of בו: The word בו here means "via himself," and there is a [[{grammatical explanation} of בו]].

Grammatical explanation of בו: For those interested in grammar, בו is [[the prefix ב]] in its meaning of [["by" or "via"]] using the [[{|masculine singular }{suffix}es]] to indicate he is doing something "via _himself_." We know it isn't the verb בוא meaning "comes" because even though it is pronounced the same as בו, that verb has an א in it.

ובשלוחו: The word ובשלוחו has [[{possible meanings} of the word ובשלוחו]] and an [[{actual meaning} of the word ובשלוחו]].

Possible meanings of the word ובשלוחו: To be written.

Actual meaning of the word ובשלוחו: The word ובשלוחו is formed from [[the prefix ו]], followed by [[the prefix ב]], followed by [[the word שלוח]], followed by [[the noun suffix ו]].

The prefix ו: The prefix ו usually means "and," but can also mean "or."

The word שלוח: The word שלוח means "someone or something that is sent." For those interested in grammar, it is [masculine singular] of the [_pa'al_ passive participle tense of the shoresh שלח].

The noun suffix ו: The suffix ו when applied to a noun means "of him" or "of it."

- The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]]. Try to figure out the meaning of the sentence from the definitions of the individual words.

Literal translation: Once we know what all the individual words mean, we can produce a literal translation:
> The man is _mekadesh_, via himself or via his messenger.

Contextual summary: Synthesize context and content into a summary, and see eg does the content and the context fit, is this an answer, etc. - With questions and mehalchim.

Analyze the first clause:
In order to analyze the first clause, we will consider:
- [[Comprehension questions on the first clause]]
- [[Commentators on the first clause]]
- [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Comprehension questions on the first clause: There are observations we can make on the first clause. First, [[that it says "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

That it says "bo u'b'shlucho": In order to understand what is interesting about this wording, let's observe that there are [[several things you can mean when giving examples]], and then ask [[whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

Several things you can mean when giving examples: If I tell you "you're invited to come drive to my wedding," I might mean one of three things:
- A diyuk: I am telling you that you are only invited to come to my wedding if you come by car.
- Lav davka: I am giving an example of how you could come, but what I mean is that any way is fine
- Biggest chiddush: I am telling you that you can come any way, _even_ driving, implying that for some reason it is more surprising that you'd be allowed to drive than other examples, and that all the more so it is also fine to use less-surprising forms of transportation.

Whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho": When the Mishnah gives an example of how something is done, does it generally mean for you to understand it as a diyuk, a lav-davka example, or as the biggest chiddush, and all the more so the din applies to less surprising cases?

Commentators on the first clause:
There are commentators who discuss the first clause:
- [[Rashi on Kiddushin 41a _ha'ish mekadesh bo u'b'shlucho_]]

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboy]].

Literal translation of the first clause: A literal translation of the first clause of the Mishnah might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Second clause:
This is the second clause of the Mishnah:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
It has context, content, and commentary.

Third clause:
This is the third clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
It has context, content, and commentary.

[Lashonos/Binyanim]

* Active: "Active" is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Active verbs represent actions where [[the person being described is the one doing the action]]. There are [[several active binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is the one doing the action: Active verbs represent actions where the person being described is the one doing the action, as opposed to [[passive]] verbs. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |

 the verb לִקְנוֹת means "to buy," and because it is active, the one being described is the one who is buying, as opposed to describing the thing being bought.

Several active binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several active binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew's active [[simple]] binyan is called the [[_pa'al_]]
- Hebrew's active [[intensive]] binyan is called the [[_pi'el_]]
- Hebrew's active [[causative]] binyan is called the [[_hif'il_]]
- Aramaic's active simple binyan is called the [[_pe'al_]]
- Aramaic's active intensive binyan is called the [[_pa'el_]]
- Aramaic's active causative binyan is called the [[_af'el_]]


* Binyan: "Binyan" is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English. A [[shoresh]] gets put into one of several binyanim in order to produce a verb, (see for example [[קדש]]. A binyan is [[like a flavor of the shoresh]]. Every binyan is a combination of [[five basic types of action]]. English [[uses alternative means to achieve the same effect]].  There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]]. There are also [[nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim]].

Like a flavor of the shoresh: You can think of a binyan as being a "flavor" of meaning that gets mixed with the shoresh to produce a verb. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Shoresh Meaning*| *Binyan* | *Binyan Meaning* | *Resulting Verb* |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| אכל | eating | [[_hif'il_]] | causing someone else to do something | to cause someone to eat i.e. to feed |
| כתב | writing | [[_pi'el_]] | doing something more intensely | to write intensely i.e. to engrave |
| קנה | buying | [[_nif'al_]] | having something done to you | to have someone buy you i.e. to be purchased |

Five basic types of action: There are five "types" of action:
- [[Active]]: Someone doing something themselves
- [[Passive]]: Someone having something done to them
- [[Simple]]: Someone doing a very straight-forward version of an action
- [[Intensive]]: Someone doing an intense or repetitive version of an action
- [[Causative]]: Someone causing someone else do an action
All of the different binyanim of Hebrew and Aramaic are combinations of these five ideas. For example, the [[_hif'il_]] is active, and causative.

Uses alternative means to achieve the same effect: In English, we do not use "binyan" to produce families of related verbs. Rather, we [[make larger verbs out of multiple words]], and [[use entirely separate words for related concepts]].

Nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim: Every verb has one binyan, and there are nouns and adjectives that come from a verb in a particular binyan. For example, from every _pi'el_ verb you can produce a _pi'el_ noun with the same meaning by using [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]].

Make larger verbs out of multiple words: In English, you have one simple verb like "eat," and then you can add other words to form larger ideas like "he made someone eat," or "he was eaten," etc, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of these permutations will be entirely different one-word verbs with similar spellings because they are formed from the same [[shoresh]] root.

Use entirely separate words for related concepts: In English, words that have related meanings do not necessarily look similar. For example, you might have verbs like "buy" and "sell" that have related meanings but no visual similarity, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, a word like "to buy" (לִקְנוֹת) and word like "to sell" (לְהִיקָּנוֹת) would be verbs formed from two different binyans of the same [[shoresh]] קנה, and so will have a similar spelling.

A shoresh is put "into" a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל "to eat," לְהַאֲכִיל "to feed," or adjective אָכוּל "eaten."


* Binyanim: There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].


* Causative: "Causative" is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Causative verbs often describe [[an action that makes something else change]]. A binyan that is causative has verbs that are causative and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]]:

An action that makes something else change: Causative verbs often describe an action that makes someone or something else become a certain way. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Causative verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to make someone else eat (ie to feed) |
| חזר | to return | to make something return (ie to return something) |
| בוה | to come | to make something come (ie to bring something) |
| זכר | to remember | to make something be remembered (ie to mention) |

Several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic
- Hebrew's [["active"]] causative binyan is called the [[_hif'il_]]
- Hebrew's [["passive"]] causative binyan is called the [[_huf'al_]]
- Aramaic's "active" causative binyan is called the [[_af'el_]]
- Aramaic's "passive" causative binyan is called the [[_itaf'al_]]


* Intensive: "Intensive" is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Intensive verbs often have meanings that are [[intensive or repetitive]]. A binyan that is intensive has verbs that are intensive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Intensive or repetitive: Intensive verbs often have meanings that are more intensive or repetitive versions of their associated [[shoresh]], although sometimes the meaning is [[causative]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Intensive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| שבר | to break | to shatter |
| חשב | to think | to calculate |
| יקר | to value | to increase the price of something |
| ישב | to sit | to create a settlement |
| כלה | to finish | to annihilate |
| כתב | to write | to engrave |
| עור | to wake up | to arouse or energize someone |
Ultimately these are just rules of thumb, and you can never be sure exactly what an intensive verb will mean just by looking at the meaning of its shoresh.

Several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew's [["active"]] intensive binyan is the [[_pa'al_]]
- Hebrew's [["passive"]] intensive binyan is the [[_nif'al_]]
- Aramaic's "active" intensive binyan is the [[_pe'al_]]
- Aramaic's "passive" intensive [[_ispe'el_]]


* Passive: "Passive" is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Passive verbs usually represent actions where [[the person being described is having an action done to them]]. A binyan that is passive has verbs that are passive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are several passive binyanim [[in Hebrew]] and [[in Aramaic]].

The person being described is having an action done to them: Passive verbs represent actions where the thing being described is having an action done to them, as opposed to verbs that are [[active]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |
This is a rule of thumb, although sometimes passive verbs have [[{{reflexive}} meanings]].

In Hebrew:
There are several passive binyanim in Hebrew:
- Hebrew's passive [[simple]] binyan is called the [[_nif'al_]]
- Hebrew's passive [[intensive]] binyan is called the [[_pu'al_]]
- Hebrew's passive [[causative]] binyan is called the [[_huf'al_]]
- Hebrew's [[reflexive]] binyan the [[hispa'el]] can sometimes have a passive meaning.

In Aramaic:
There are several passive binyanim in Aramaic:
- Aramaic's passive simple binyan is called the [[_ispe'el_]]
- Aramaic has no passive intensive binyan.
- Aramaic's passive causative binyan is called the [[_itaf'al_]]
- Aramaic's reflexive binyan the [[ispa'al]] can sometimes have a passive meaning


* Reflexive: "Reflexive" is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Reflexive verbs often refer to [[circular]] or [[transformative actions]]. A binyan that is reflexive has verbs that are reflexive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Circular: Reflexive verbs often describe an action where the doer does something to themselves, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| לבש | to dress | to dress oneself |
| בדד | to seperate | to go into isolation |
| בלל | to mix | to assimilate |
| גדר | to fence | to limit oneself to something |
 the shoresh לבש corresponds to the concept of clothing, and the causative verb from that shoresh is לְהִתְלַבֵּשׁ, which means "to dress oneself."

Transformative actions: Reflexive verbs can also refer to situations where an entity undergoes a transformation, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| חדש | to be new | to revitalize |
| זקן | to be old | to grow old |
| חרש | to be deaf | to become deaf |

Several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew's reflexive binyan is called the [[_hispa'el_]]
- Aramaic's reflexive binyan is called the [[_ispa'al_]]
- Hebrew and Aramaic's [[passive]] verbs also sometimes have reflexive meanings.


* Simple: "Simple" (also known as _kal_) is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Simple verbs usually have [[meanings that are similar to their shoresh]]. A binyan that is simple has verbs that are simple and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several "simple" binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Meanings that are similar to their shoresh: Simple verbs have meanings that are very similar to their associated [[shoresh]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *Simple verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | eating | to eat |
| הלח | walking | to walk |
| אמר | speech | to say |
| ישב | sitting | to sit |

 the shoresh אכל represents the idea of eating, whereas the simple verb of that shoresh is לֶאֱכוֹל, which means "to eat."

Several simple binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:

* Different things a ה at the start of a word could mean:
A word beginning with ה could be:
- a name beginning with ה, eg הוֹשֵׁעַ (_Hoshea_)
- [[a word formed from a shoresh beginning with ה]]
- a noun starting with [[the Hebrew version of the word "the"]]
- a [[past-tense verb that begins with ה]]
- an [[imperative verb that begin with ה]]
- part of [[a type of noun that begins with ה]]

A word formed from a shoresh beginning with ה: A ה at the start of a word might be part of a word formed from a [[shoresh]] beginning with ה, such as the shoresh הלך, which produces nouns like הֲלִיכָה (_halicha_, the activity of walking), and verbs like הוֹלֵךְ (_holech_, he is walking).

The Hebrew version of the word "the": A ה at the start of a word might be the Hebrew version of the word "the", for example הַאֶבֶן, "the rock," formed from the word אֶבֶן, meaning "rock."

Past-tense verb that begins with ה:
There are two kinds of [[past tense]] verb that begin with ה:
- A [[shoresh]] like אכל can produce a verb that looks like הֶאֱכִיל with a י between the second and third letters. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_hif'il_]]).
- A shoresh like לבש can produce a verb that looks like הִתְלַבֵּשׁ with a ת after the ה as the second letter. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_his'pael_]] verb).

Imperative verb that begin with ה:
There are two kinds of [[{{imperative}} ("command")]] verb that begin with ה:
- A shoresh like אכל can produce a verb that looks like הֶאֱכִיל with a י between the second and third letters. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_hif'il_]]).
- A shoresh like לבש can produce a verb that looks like הִתְלַבֵּשׁ with a ת after the ה as the second letter. (For advanced readers, this is called a [[_his'pael_]] verb).

A type of noun that begins with ה:
In Hebrew and Aramaic, there are [["noun patterns"]] which are families of noun that sound the same and have related meanings. There are several such patterns that produce nouns beginning with ה:
- [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _hiskattlut_ noun pattern]]


* Different things a מ at the start of a word could mean: The letter מ at the start of a word could mean several things.
- A מ at the start of a word might be part of the actual word, for example מלח which means salt.
- A מ at the start of a word might be short for מין, meaning "from," for example מבבל, "from Bavel."
- A מ at the start of a word might be the word part of a comparison, corresponding to the word "than," for example יותר מזה, "more than that."
- A מ at the start of a word might be part of the [[participle]] of an [[intensive]] verb in Hebrew or Aramaic, for example מדבר, "he is speaking."
- A מ at the start of a word might be part of the [[participle]] of a [[causative]] verb in Hebrew or Aramaic, for example מבדיל, "he is separating."


* Hebrew definite article:


[Lashonos/Grammar]

* Hebrew nouns: Hebrew has various types of nouns. Hebrew nouns [[by default have an indefinite article]], or they can have a hay ha'yedia, which is the definite article.

By default have an indefinite article: The Hebrew word איש, for example, means "a man", not just "man" and there is no specific word in Hebrew for "a".


[Lashonos/Nouns]

* Hebrew noun patterns: Hebrew has several noun patterns, which are letter and vowel templates that accept shorushim to produce nouns. Nouns formed from a certain pattern often have a similar meaning relative to the shoresh. Noun patterns [[have a naming convention]]. These are some of the noun patterns in Hebrew:
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pa'al_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pi'el_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hif'il_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hispa'el_ verbs]]

Have a naming convention: Noun patterns are named by putting the shoresh קטל into the given pattern, the same way that binyan names are formed by putting the shoresh פעל into the third-person masculine past-tense form of that binyan.


* Noun Patterns: There are [[Hebrew noun patterns]] and Aramaic noun patterns.


* Noun patterns that come from _Hif'il_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hif'il_]] verbs include:
- [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]
- [[the _taktil_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Hispa'el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_hispa'el_]] verbs include:
- [[The _hiskattlut_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pa'al_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pa'al_]] verbs include:
- [[the _ktila_ noun pattern]]


* Noun patterns that come from _Pi'el_ verbs:
The noun patterns that come from [[_pi'el_]] verbs include:
- [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]]


* Relationship between nouns in the _hektel_ noun pattern and the _haktala_ noun pattern:
There is a standard difference between nouns in [[the _hektel_ noun pattern]] and [[the _haktala_ noun pattern]]:
| *_Shoresh_* | *_Hif'il_ verb* | *_Hektel_ noun* | *_Haktala_ noun* |
|-|-|-|-|
| דבל<br> seperation | הִדְבִּיל<br> _hivdil_ <br> he seperated | הֶבְדֵּל<br> _hevdel_ <br> a difference / seperation | הַבְדָּלָה<br> _havdalah_ <br>an act of seperation |
| קדש<br> holiness | הִקְדִּישׁ<br> _hikdish_ <br> he donated to the temple | הֶקְדֵּשׁ <br> _hekdesh_ <br> property of the temple |  הַקְדָּשָׁה<br> _hakdasha_ <br> an act of donation to the temple |
| קשר<br> connection | הִקְשִׁיר<br> _hikshir_ <br> he connected | הֶקְשֵׁר<br> _heksher_ <br> a connection | הַקְשָׁרָה<br> _hakshara_ <br> an act of connecting |
As you can see, the _hif'il_ verb represents an action, then the _haktala_ noun will be an instance of that action, and the _hektel_ noun will be the _result_ of that action. Not every _hif'il_ verb however will have both a _hektel_ and a _haktala_ form. For a full list of _hektel-haktala_ word pairs, see [Klein on _havdalah_](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B8%D7%94.1).

[Lashonos/Shoresh]

* Four-letter shorushim: While most shorushim have three letters, and some arguably have two letters, sometimes we see shorushim that seem to have four distinct letters, like שבעד meaning subjugation, or טלטל meaning movement. These shorushim only have verbs in the "heavy" binyanim like the _pi'el_ because the doubled middle letter creates room for four consonant sounds, and the four letters of the root use those gaps:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *[[_Pi'el_]] example* | *Transliteration* |
|-|-|-|-|
| דבר | speech | מְדַבֵּר | _me<b>d</b>a<b>b</b>'<b>b</b>e<b>r</b>_ |
| שעבד | subjugation | מְשַׁעְבֵּד | _me<b>sh</b>a'<b>a</b>-<b>b</b>ei<b>d</b>_ |
| טלטל | movement | לְטַלְטֵל | _me<b>t</b>a<b>l</b>'<b>t</b>e<b>l</b>_ |
Four letter shorushim often are produced from regular shorushim via certain rules, such as in the [[_shaf'el_]] and the [[_pilpul_]] forms.


* Irregular shorushim: An irregular shoresh, as opposed to [[regular shorushim]], is a [[shoresh]] that has special letters that affect the vowelization of verbs produced from it. Here are some examples of irregular shorushim having irregular verb conjugations:
| *Shoresh* | *Oddity* | *Expected* | * Real* | *Comment* |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ישב | י in first position | מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv_) | מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv_) | י changes to וֹ |
| נפל | נ in the first position | מַנְפִּיל (_manpil_) | מַפִּיל (_map'pil_) | נ drops and the פ is doubled |
| בנה | ה in the last position | בָּנַהְתִּי  (_baunah'ti_) | בָּנִיתִי (_bauniti_) | the consonant ה becomes an יִ vowel |
There is a [[special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim]].

Special naming convention for describing categories of irregular shorushim: We use the traditional [[shoresh letter numbering convention]] to produce an [[irregular shoresh naming convention]].

Shoresh letter numbering convention:
In Hebrew grammar, the shoresh פעל is used as a "standard" shoresh, and so sometimes the letters of פעל are used as names for the three shoresh positions:
| פ | ע | ל |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 For example, instead of saying "the first letter of the shoresh נפל," you might say "the פ of the shoresh נפל."

Irregular shoresh naming convention:
Because we use the letters פעל as names for the positions in a shoresh, if we want to say "the category of shorushim that have a י in the first position," the name would be "י״פ verbs" (_yud-pay verbs_.)

A common example is a shoresh that has a י in the first position, such as ישב, where the י will often becomes a ו in verb forms that have prefixes, for example having מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv_) instead of the more typical מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv_), which might be harder to pronounce.


* Pilpul: The _pilpul_ is a form where a weak shoresh with only two strong letters (eg טול) or a shoresh with a repeated second letter (eg לחח) has the first and last letters doubled to produce a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif'el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| טול | to move | טלטל | to teeter about |
| לחח | to be moist | לחלח | to moisten |
| בלל | to mix | בלבל | to confuse |
| משׁשׁ | to touch | משׁמשׁ | to examine physically |
The meaning of the _pilpul_ form is often a more repetitive version of the meaning of the two-letter form. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _pilpul_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi'el_]], [[_pu'al_]], and [[_hispa'el_]] forms.


* Regular shorushim: A regular [[shoresh]] is a shoresh where the vowels and spelling of verbs that are produced from that shoresh follow the normal patterns for each verb form. This is as opposed to [[irregular shorushim]].


* Shaf'el: The _shaf'el_ form is when a shoresh like עבד gets a ש added to the front to produce a new shoresh שעבד. A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf'el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]] and a shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf'el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif'el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| עבד | work | שעבד | subjugate (to make someone else work) |
| זרע | seeding | שזרע | reseeding (causing to become seeded) |
| נוע | moving | שנע | transporting (causing to move) |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf'el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi'el_]], [[_pu'al_]], and [[_hispa'el_]] forms.


* Shoresh: A shoresh is a grammatical entity in Hebrew and Aramaic. The word shoresh [[means root]]. A shoresh is [[a series of letters]] and [[represents a range of meaning]]. Here are some examples:
| *Shoresh* | אכל | שלח | ראה |
|-|-|-|-|
| *Meaning* | eating | sending | sight |
Shorushim are [[used to produce words]]. Shorushim have [[corollaries in English]]. There is a [[debate over the exact definition of a shoresh]]. There are [[regular and irregular shorushim]].

Means root: The Hebrew word שורש can mean "root" or "source," but in this context it means root in the sense that a words like "memory" and "memorize" come from the linguistic _root_ "mem."

A series of letters: A shoresh looks like a series of two or three letters like קדש or מת, but sometimes have [[four-letter{ shorushim|s}]].

Represents a range of meaning: A shoresh represents a broad category of meaning, like "holiness" for קדש, or "death" for מת.

There is a debate in grammar whether to think of two letter roots like מת as being two letters, or really three letters like מות.

Corollaries in English: In English, you often have a linguistic root like "mem" which is used to produce a series of related words like "memory," "memorize," or "memorable." Shorushim are a similar concept, except they are a bit more formal than in English, because there are fixed rules for how many letters they can be, and how they get turned into words.

Used to produce words: A shoresh that has a general meaning is used to generate many words with more specific meanings. For example, the shoresh אכל "eating" is plugged into a pattern like `‏הֶ _ _ י _‏` to generate the verb הֶאֱכִיל, "to feed." (For advanced readers, this form is called the [[hif'il]].)

Debate over the exact definition of a shoresh: Often we see words that only seem to have two root letters, like מת, and there is a debate over whether to think of these as being a special type of "two letter" shoresh, or whether to think of them as being a three-letter shoresh like מות that loses the middle letter in certain conjugations, but this dispute has no practical ramifications because everyone agrees on the spelling of the words that come from two-letter shorushim.

Regular and irregular shorushim: Shorushim can be [[{regular} shorushim]] or [[{irregular} shorushim]].


[Lashonos/Shorushim/בעה]

* The shoresh בעה: "בעה" is a shoresh in Aramaic that can mean "requesting", "searching" or "needing".

[Lashonos/Tenses]

* Future Tense: The future tense is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Imperative: The imperative, also known as "the command," is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Infinitive: The infinitive is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Participle: The participle (sometimes called _lashon po'el_) is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]]. It is similar to English "ing" verbs, like "running." The participle [[has various uses]], and it [[has various forms]].

Has various uses: The Hebrew and Aramaic participle [[corresponds to both the English present and participle]]. It can be [[used for various time periods]], and can [[function as a noun or adjective]].

Has various forms: There are multiple versions of the participle [[versions {in Hebrew}]] and [[versions {in Aramaic}]], and for each version there are conjugations [[for gender and number]].

Corresponds to both the English present and participle: Whereas in English you can say "he is writing" or "he writes," in Hebrew and Aramaic, both of these meanings would be expressed with the same participle eg הוא כותב, _hu koisev_, and so when we see the word כותב, we can't be sure without context whether it is referring to someone who is writing right now, or someone writes habitually.

Used for various time periods: A word in the participle technically [[has no time]], and can be used [[in the past]], [[in the present]], or [[in the future]].

Has no time: A word in the participle of Hebrew or Aramaic does not alone tell us what time the action happened. This is like the English word "running," which only describes an action, not when it happened. We require the context of the sentence to determine the time of the action.

In the past: The participle can be used in the past tense, for example הוא היה כותב, _hu haya koisev_ meaning "he used to write" or "he used to be writing." If you wanted to say "he wrote," ie a one-time past event instead of an ongoing past event, you would just use the regular [[past tense]], and not the "past-tense version" of the participle.

In the present: The participle can be used in the present tense by adding a noun before the verb, for example, הוא כותב, _hu koisev_, meaning "he is writing" or "he writes."

In the future: The participle can be used in the future tense, for example, הוא יהיה כותב, _hu yiyeh koisev_, meaning "he will be writing." If you wanted to say "he will write," ie a one-time future event, you would just use the regular [[future tense]] and not the "future version" of the participle.

Function as a noun or adjective: Words in the participle can function [[as nouns]] or [[as adjectives]].

As nouns: The participle can function as a noun in two ways, [[describing someone doing the action]], or [[describing an instance of an action]].

Describing someone doing the action:
The participle can function as a noun describing someone or something doing the given action. For example:
| Hebrew  | *כּוֹתֵב* צָרִיךְ פֶּֽתֶק |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _*koisev* tzarich petek_ |
| English | *a person who is running* needs shoes. |
Here, we see the Hebrew word "running" can also mean "a person who is running." Putting a ה in front of the word ie הַכּוֹתֵב would mean "the one who runs."

Describing an instance of an action:
The participle can function as a noun describing someone or something doing the given action. For example:
| Hebrew  | *כּוֹתֵב* שלו תמיד |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _*koisev* shelo tamid_ |
| English | his *writing* is constant |
Here, we see that the Hebrew word "writing" can be used as a noun, meaning "this particular instance of the act of writing."

As adjectives: A participle can function as an adjective, eg:
| Hebrew  | שמעון *קודש* |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _Shimeon *kodesh*_ |
| English | Shimeon is *holy*, or Shimeon is *being holy* |
In English, "holy" is an adjective and "being holy" is a verb, but in Hebrew and Aramaic, the same participle word "קודש" would be used for both.

Versions in Hebrew:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Hebrew binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)

| [[_Nif'al_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | נִכְתָּב | _nicht'tov_ | Nif'al#Participle |
| [[_Pi'el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְכַתֵּב | _mechat'teiv_ | Pi'el#Participle |
| [[_Pu'al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְכֻתָּב | _mechut'tov_ | _Pu'al#Participle |

Versions in Aramaic:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| Binyan        | Type | Example | Transliteration |
|---------------|------|---------|----------------|
| [[_Pe'al_]] | [[simple]], [[active]] | כָּתֵיב | _kauseiv_ |
| [[_Ispe'el_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | מִתְכְּתִב | _miskesiv_ |
| [[_Pa'el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְקַדֵּיש | _mekad'deish_ |
| [[_Ispa'al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְתְקַדַש | _miskadash_ |
| [[_Af'el_]] | [[causative]], [[active]] | מַכְתִּיב | _machtiv_ |
| [[_Itaf'al_]] | [[causative]] [[passive]], or [[reflexive]] | מִתַּפְקַד | _mitafkad_ |

For gender and number:
The participle is conjugated for gender and number:
| Person | Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Masculine singular | כּוֹתֵב | _koiseiv_ | one man writing |
| Feminine singular | כּוֹתֶבֶת | _koiseves_ | one woman writing |
| Masculine plural | כּוֹתְבִים | _koisvim_ | multiple men writing |
| Feminine plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _koisvois_ | multiple women writing |
This is unlike the [[past tense]] or [[future tense]] that have [[separate forms for person]]. This is because the participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is [[like an adjective]].

Separate forms for person: Tenses other than the participle have conjugations for every person, eg the [[_pa'al_]] [[past tense]]:
| *Person* | *Hebrew* | *Transliteration* | *Meaning* |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| First singular | כָּתַבְתִּי | _kosavti_ | I wrote |
| First person plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosavnu_ | We wrote |
| Second singular masculine | כָּתַבְתָּ | _kosavto_ | You (man) wrote |
| Second singular feminine | כָּתַבְתְּ | _kosavt_ | You (woman) wrote |
| Second plural masculine | כְּתַבְתֶּם | _ksavtem_ | You (men) wrote |
| Second plural feminine | כְּתַבְתֶּן | _ksavten_ | You (women) wrote |
| Third plural masculine | כָּתַב | _kosav_ | He wrote |
| Third plural feminine | כָּתְבָה | _kosvo_ | She wrote |
| They/those | כָּתְבוּ | _kosvu_ | They wrote |

Like an adjective: The participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is more like an adjective than a verb, with "he is running" having the same grammatical form as "he is tall." (This example uses the participle of the [[_{{pa'al}} binyan_]]. [[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)


* Past tense: The past tense is one of the [[verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Verb forms of Hebrew and Aramaic: There are several verb forms in Hebrew and Aramaic:
| [[Past Tense]] | [[Future Tense]] | [[Participle]] |
| [[Imperative]] | [[Infinitive]] | \^ |


[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].

Rashi and Tosofos are daf subtopics?

Why not two halachos to learn and two makomos? We see from the Gemara's aval that you need to be clear about your source.

Nami being the Gemara speaking.

You can tell ב isn't short for בתוך because there is also מתוך

First kasha - ways of reading the mishna even/only/for example. 2nd answer of the gemara - oddity of seeing vs shlichus, R Yosef vs RYAR being there, after 2 answers - why doesn't the gemara stop.

Go on a socratic explanation of pa'ul vs nifal? Participle adjectives?

First establish _that_ a text is an answer, then ask _whether_ it is ie actually an answer.
