Hebrew definite article: The Hebrew definite article is a grammatical entity in the Hebrew language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[definite article]], one of the two types of [[articles]].
- In Hebrew, the definite article is a ה prefix before a noun, usually vowelized הַ, _ha_.
- Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the prefix ב]] or [[the prefix ל]] and becomes a בַ or לַ.
- Aramaic also has a [[Aramaic {definite article}]], but it is an א suffix, like עָלְמָא (_alma,_ “the world”)
