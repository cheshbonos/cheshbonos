Weak letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “weak” in that it is not clear if they are part of a word’s [[shoresh]] or whether they are added as vowels or part of a conjugation. Sometimes, weak letters act as consonants, and are pronounced strongly.
- The weak letters are ‎א, ‎ע, ‎ה, ‎ח, ‎י, ‎ו, and ‎נ.
- Letters that are not weak are [[strong letters]].
