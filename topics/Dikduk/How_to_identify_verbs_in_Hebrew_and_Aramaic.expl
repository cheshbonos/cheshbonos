How to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic: This is what you need to know to identify a verb in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Every verb comes from a [[shoresh]].
- A shoresh gets put into a [[“binyan”]] which produces a verb, which might have several possible meanings. If you can figure out the shoresh and binyan, that will narrow down the action being spoken about to a few possibilities, but we still wont know who is doing the action, or when.
- Next we try to determine [[“tenses” of Hebrew and Aramaic|the tense of the verb]], like the [[future tense]] or [[past tense]].
- Next we try to determine the “person” of the verb, eg first-person (“I run”) or “second-person” (“you run”), etc.
- So, when we see a verb in the Gemara, we want to identify the shoresh, the binyan, the tense, and the person.
