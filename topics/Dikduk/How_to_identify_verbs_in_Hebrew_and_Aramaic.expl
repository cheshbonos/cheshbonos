How to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic: This is what you need to know to identify a verb in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Every verb comes from a [[shoresh]].
- A shoresh gets put into a [[“binyan”]] which produces a verb, which might have several possible meanings.
- A verb is then conjugated into a particular [[verb {form}s of Hebrew and Aramaic]], like the [[future tense]] or [[infinitive]].
- Within a form there are several “persons,” eg “first-person” (“I run”) or “second-person” (“you run”), etc.
- So, when we see a verb in the Gemara, we want to identify the shoresh, the binyan, the form, and the person.
