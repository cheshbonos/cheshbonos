_Itaf’al_ Imperative for regular shorushim:
The [[{{_itaf’al_ imperative}} form]] does not occur frequently enough in the Talmud to determine its regular conjugations. This is the conjugation pattern of the _itaf’al_ in _Targum Onkolos_ for [[regular shorushim]]:
|            | *Masculine* | *Feminine* |
| *Singular* | אִיתַּפְקַד <br><br> _itafkad!_ <br><br><br> [to a man] <br> be deposited! | אִיתַּפְקַדִי <br><br> _itafkadi!_ <br><br><br> [to a woman] <br> be deposited! |
| *Plural*   | אִיתַּפְקַדוּ <br><br> _itafkadu!_ <br><br><br> [to men] <br> be deposited! | אִיתַּפְקַדָא <br><br> _itafkadau!_ <br><br><br> [to women] <br> be deposited! |
[^1]: Because Aramaic was a less-formal spoken language, it often has several versions of the same word. Parentheses indicate letters that sometimes are omitted.
[^2]: For any regular shoresh, you can replace the letters ‎מ, ‎ס, and ר above with the letters of your shoresh to produce the proper conjugations.
[^3]: Attempts to vowelize the Gemara are speculative. These conjugations are based on R Yitzchok Frank’s _Grammar for Gemara_.
