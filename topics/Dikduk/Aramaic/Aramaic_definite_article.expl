Aramaic definite article:
The Aramaic definite article is a grammatical entity in the Aramaic language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[definite article]], one of the two types of [[articles]].
- In Aramaic, the definite article is an א suffix after a noun, usually vowelized אָ, _au_.
- Sometimes Aramaic uses the א suffix in situations that we wouldn’t use the word “the” in English, for difficult to understand reasons.
- Hebrew also has a [[Hebrew {definite article}]], but it is a ה prefix, like הַמֶלֶךְ (_hamelech,_ “the king.”)
