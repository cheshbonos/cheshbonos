Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Words like “running” which are called “participles” require a pronoun like “I” to clarify who is doing the action, eg “I am running.”
- In Aramaic, we can attach the pronoun to the end of the verb, for example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- (As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].)
- These are the Aramaic words that get added as suffixes:
| ‎אֲנָא ‎ <br><br> _anau_ <br><br><br> I | ‎אַתְּ‎ <br><br> _at_ <br><br><br> You [man or woman] |
| ‎אֲנַן‎ <br><br> _anan_ <br><br><br> We | ‎אַתּוּ/ן‎ <br><br> _atu/n_ <br><br><br> You [men or women] |
