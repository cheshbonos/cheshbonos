Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Ordinarily, a participle is a word like “running” and doesn’t reflect who is doing the action, thus requiring a pronoun like אֲנִי (_ani_, “I”), like in the sentence “I am running.”
- In Aramaic however, we can append the pronoun to the end of the verb and produce a composite word that specifies who is doing the action.
- For example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” or “he” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].
