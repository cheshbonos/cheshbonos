Participle: The participle is a category of verb form.
- An example of a word in the participle is “burning” or “running.”
- Hebrew and Aramaic have [[an {{"ongoing" participle}} form]] and [[a {{"finished" participle}} form]].
- Unlike words in the past or future tense which can be used alone as full sentences, participle words are only meaningful when combined with other words in [[one of several {{"participle constructions"}}]].
