Participle: The participle is a category of verb that appears in most languages.
- An example of a word in the participle is “burning” or “running.”
- Hebrew and Aramaic have two participle forms, [[the {{“active” participle}} form]], and [[the {{“passive” participle}} form]].
- Unlike words in the past or future tense which can be used alone as full sentences, participle words only form meaningful sentences when combined with other words in one of several “[[{{participle constructions}}]].”
