Articles: Articles are a grammatical entity that exists in most languages.
- Articles are words like “the” or “a” that come before a noun.
- Articles clarify whether the thing being spoken about is known to the listener (“the dog” i.e. the [[definite article]]), or whether we are speaking in general (“a dog” i.e. the [[indefinite article]].)
