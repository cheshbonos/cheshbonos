- Question on Rashi, seems random
- It is a rule
- Why two answers?
- First answer has a better rule, second answer has a better timeline
- How can you say the first answer has a better rule when the Gur Aryeh uses the same lashon to describe the certainty of both rules?
- You can only know what a person is saying based on who they are speaking to, and what they are trying to exclude
- Who is the Gur Aryeh speaking to? Someone who disagrees with the rule? But he offers no arguments
- Clearly he is speaking to someone who doesn't have any idea there is a rule, and is coming to say "Rashi is coming from a rule"
- In which case, the fact he uses the same lashon for both rules doesn't mean he thinks they're equally good, and so he can agree to our pros/cons
