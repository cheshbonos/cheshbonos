The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is [[{{picture}}d here]]. The Mishnah as a whole has [[{context} of the Mishnah]], and you can select a particular clause to learn more.
< [[האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו]] [[האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה]] [[האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו]]

Context of the Mishnah: The Mishnah has [[required background information]], a [[position in the perek]], and relates to a particular [[topic in halacha]].

Required background information: This Mishnah presumes familiarity with the [[_halachic_ steps of marriage]], and with the [[concept of _shlichus_]].

_Halachic_ steps of marriage: In Jewish law, a state of marriage is produced by two steps, [[_kiddushin_]] and [[_nisuyin_]].

_kiddushin_: The first step of Jewish marriage is called _erusin_ or _kiddushin_. After _kiddushin_, the woman is designated to the man for marriage and would need a halachic divorce in order to remarry. However, the couple is not yet married, and may not live together or have physical contact. The first Mishnah of _Maseches Kiddushin_ discusses the different ways in which a man and woman can produce a state of _kiddushin_. _Kiddushin_ is sometimes translated as "engagement" although the binding nature of _kiddushin_ is one difference between it and ordinary engagement.

_nisuyin_: The second step of Jewish marriage is called _nisuyin_. After _kiddushin_, the couple must create a state of _nisuyin_ in order to be formally married. In the times of the Gemara _nisuyin_ might be done a year after _kiddushin_. Today, however, _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are done in the same wedding ceremony. Typically _nisuyin_ is done by having the wife enter the residence of the groom, either his actual residence, or more commonly the _chupah_ or _yichud_ room.

Concept of _shlichus_: In _halacha_, there are various actions a person can do that produce _halachic_ consequences, such as buying and selling goods, or doing a _mitzvah_ like giving _tzeddukah_. In this _perek_, we will see that some of these actions can be performed by an emissary, or _shaliach_, who is designated beforehand by the individual, and the individual is credited with the action the emissary performs. Which actions can be done via _shaliach_ and other questions regarding _shlichus_ will be the primary topic of this Mishnah and the Gemaras that discuss it.

Position in the perek: This is the first Mishnah in the second _perek_ of _Maseches Kiddushin_. The first _perek_ began by discussing the different methods a man can use to be _mekadesh_ a woman, and this Mishnah will continue to discuss related topics.

Topic in halacha: This Mishnah will discuss which aspects of the marriage process can be done via a _shaliach_. Think to yourself now, what parts would you guess can be done by _shaliach_, and which parts would you think one wouldn't be able to do via _shaliach_?

האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
The first clause of the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is quoted below.
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
The first clause has [[context]], [[content]], and [[commentary]].

Context: The first clause of the Mishnah is discussing whether a man can halachically engage a woman via a messenger without himself being present. Before reading on, stop and ask yourself, do you think this would work? Why or why not?

Content: To learn the first clause of the Mishna inside, we must [[identify the sentence break]], understand the [[individual words]], produce a [[literal translation]], and a cumulative [[interpretation]].

Identify the sentence break:
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends? By reading the Mishnah, we should notice a pattern:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Lets mark similar looking words even if we don't know what they mean:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו

< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]

האיש: The word האיש has [[{possible meanings} of האיש]] and a [[{definition} of האיש]].

Possible meanings of האיש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word. The word האיש has [[the letter ה at the start of a word]].

Definition of האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the "definite article" ה]].

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means "man."

the "definite article" ה: The prefix ה in front of a noun in Hebrew is the "definite article" similar to the English word "the."

Possible meanings of מקדש: Try to use the following hints to guess the meaning of the word. The word מקדש begins with [[{the letter מ} at the start of a word]].

Basic explanation: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") means "[someone is] making something holy," usually used in the context of a man creating the legal status of "kiddushin" with a woman prior to marriage, but it can also be used for the creation of holiness in general, for example, Hashem is _mekadesh es ha'shabbos_ ie makes the Shabbos holy.

Advanced explanation: For those interested in grammar, the word מקדש is the the [[_pi'el_]] participle of [[the shoresh קדש]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning "someone who makes something holy", a verb, someone or something "is making holy," or an adjective, something has "the quality of making something holy."

בו: The word בו can mean "with him/it," "on him/it," "inside him/it," and "because of him/it." For those interested in grammar, it is [[the prefix ב]] with a [[{pronominal suffix}es]].

- The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]]. Try to figure out the meaning of the sentence from the definitions of the individual words.

Literal translation:

Interpretation: Synthesize context and content into a summary, and see eg does the content and the context fit, is this an answer, etc. - With questions and mehalchim.

Commentary: There are [[{{observations we can make}} on the first clause]], [[mefarshim on the first clause]], and [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

- Comprehension questions instead of observations?

Observations we can make: There are observations we can make on the first clause. First, [[that it says "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

That it says "bo u'b'shlucho": In order to understand what is interesting about this wording, let's observe that there are [[several things you can mean when giving examples]], and then ask [[whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

Several things you can mean when giving examples: If I tell you "you're invited to come drive to my wedding," I might mean one of three things:
- A diyuk: I am telling you that you are only invited to come to my wedding if you come by car.
- Lav davka: I am giving an example of how you could come, but what I mean is that any way is fine
- Biggest chiddush: I am telling you that you can come any way, _even_ driving, implying that for some reason it is more surprising that you'd be allowed to drive than other examples, and that all the more so it is also fine to use less-surprising forms of transportation.

Whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho": When the Mishnah gives an example of how something is done, does it generally mean for you to understand it as a diyuk, a lav-davka example, or as the biggest chiddush, and all the more so the din applies to less surprising cases?

Mefarshim on the first clause: [[Rashi on Kiddushin 41a _ha'ish mekadesh bo u'b'shlucho_]] discusses the first clause of the Mishnah.

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboy]].

Literal translation of the first clause: A literal translation of the first clause of the Mishnah might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah.

האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah.
