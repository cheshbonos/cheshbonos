The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is [[{{picture}}d here]] and quoted below. The Mishnah has [[{context} of the Mishnah]] and several [[clauses]].
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Context of the Mishnah: The Mishnah has [[required background information]], a [[position in the perek]], and relates to a particular [[subject matter]].

Required background information: This Mishnah presumes familiarity with the [[_halachic_ steps of marriage]], and with the [[concept of _shlichus_]].

_Halachic_ steps of marriage: In Jewish law, a state of marriage is produced by two steps, [[_kiddushin_]] and [[_nisuyin_]].

_kiddushin_: The first step of Jewish marriage is called _erusin_ or _kiddushin_. After _kiddushin_, the woman is designated to the man for marriage and would need a halachic divorce in order to remarry. However, the couple is not yet married, and may not live together or have physical contact. The first Mishnah of _Maseches Kiddushin_ discusses the different ways in which a man and woman can produce a state of _kiddushin_. _Kiddushin_ is sometimes translated as "engagement" although the binding nature of _kiddushin_ is one difference between it and ordinary engagement.

_nisuyin_: The second step of Jewish marriage is called _nisuyin_. After _kiddushin_, the couple must create a state of _nisuyin_ in order to be formally married. In the times of the Gemara _nisuyin_ might be done a year after _kiddushin_. Today, however, _kiddushin_ and _nisuyin_ are done in the same wedding ceremony. Typically _nisuyin_ is done by having the wife enter the residence of the groom, either his actual residence, or more commonly the _chupah_ or _yichud_ room.

Concept of _shlichus_: In _halacha_, there are various actions a person can do that produce _halachic_ consequences, such as buying and selling goods, or doing a _mitzvah_ like giving _tzeddukah_. In this _perek_, we will see that some of these actions can be performed by an emissary, or _shaliach_, who is designated beforehand by the individual, and the individual is credited with the action the emissary performs. Which actions can be done via _shaliach_ and other questions regarding _shlichus_ will be the primary topic of this Mishnah and the Gemaras that discuss it.

Position in the perek: This is the first Mishnah in the second _perek_ of _Maseches Kiddushin_. The first _perek_ began by discussing the different methods a man can use to be _mekadesh_ a woman, and this Mishnah will continue to discuss related topics.

Subject matter: This Mishnah will discuss which aspects of the marriage process can be done via a _shaliach_. Think to yourself now, what parts would you guess can be done by _shaliach_, and which parts would you think one wouldn't be able to do via _shaliach_?

Clauses: The Mishnah has a [[first clause]], a [[second clause]], and a [[third clause]].

First clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
The first clause of the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a is quoted below. The first clause has [[context]], [[content]], and [[commentary]].

Context: The first clause of the Mishnah is discussing whether a man can halachically engage a woman via a messenger without himself being present. Before reading on, stop and ask yourself, do you think this would work? Why or why not?

Content: The first clause of the Mishnah has [[individual words]], a [[literal translation]], and a [[summary]].

Individual words: The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]]. Try to figure out the meaning of the sentence from the definitions of the individual words.

Literal translation:

Summary: Synthesize context and content into a summary, and see eg does the content and the context fit, is this an answer, etc. - With questions and mehalchim.

Commentary: There are [[{{observations we can make}} on the first clause]], [[mefarshim on the first clause]], and [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Observations we can make: There are observations we can make on the first clause. First, [[that it says "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

That it says "bo u'b'shlucho": In order to understand what is interesting about this wording, let's observe that there are [[several things you can mean when giving examples]], and then ask [[whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho"]].

Several things you can mean when giving examples:

Whether we know from the Mishnah which form of specificity is meant by "bo u'b'shlucho":

Mefarshim on the first clause: [[Rashi on Kiddushin 41a _ha'ish mekadesh bo u'b'shlucho_]] discusses the first clause of the Mishnah.

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboy]].

The word האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה]].

The word איש: The word איש in Hebrew means "man."

The prefix ה: The prefix ה in Hebrew means "the."

The word מקדש: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") has a [[basic explanation]] and [[advanced explanation]].

Basic explanation: The word מקדש ("mekadesh") means "making something holy," usually used in the context of a man creating the legal status of "kiddushin" with a woman prior to marriage, but also, for example, Hashem being _mekadesh es ha'shabbos_ ie making the Shabbos holy.

Advanced explanation: For those interested in grammar, the word מקדש is the [[the _pi'el_ participle of the shoresh קדש]] in the [[masculine singular]].

Parts of speech: The word מקדש can function as a noun, meaning "someone who makes something holy", a verb, someone or something "is making holy," or an adjective, something has "the quality of making something holy."

The word בו: The word בו can mean "with him/it," "on him/it," "inside him/it," and "because of him/it." For those interested in grammar, it is [[the prefix ב]] with a [[{pronominal suffix}es]].

The word ובשלוחו: This is [[the prefix ו]], followed by [[the prefix ב]], followed by [[the word שלוח]], followed by [[the noun suffix ו]].

The prefix ו: The prefix ו usually means "and," but can also mean "or."

The word שלוח: The word שלוח means "someone or something that is sent." For those interested in grammar, it is [[masculine singular]] of the [[_pa'al_ passive participle tense of the shoresh שלח]].

The noun suffix ו: The suffix ו when applied to a noun means "of him" or "of it."

Literal translation of the first clause: A literal translation of the first clause of the Mishnah might be:
> The man is being _mekadesh_, with himself or with a _shaliach_
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Pshat in the first clause: A pshat in the first clause of the Mishna might be:
> A man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh a woman, himself or with a shaliach

Second clause:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah.

Third clause:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah.
