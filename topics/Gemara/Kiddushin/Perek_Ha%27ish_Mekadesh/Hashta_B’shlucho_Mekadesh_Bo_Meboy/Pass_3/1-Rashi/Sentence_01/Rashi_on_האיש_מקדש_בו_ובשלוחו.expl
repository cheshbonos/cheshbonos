Translate Rashi's answer:

What is bothering Rashi?
Rashi is telling us the Gemara will later explain the scriptural source for the first ruling of the Mishnah.
- If so, [[what question does Rashi think I have right now?]] (Think before clicking!)

What question does Rashi think I have right now?
Perhaps Rashi wants the reader to know that the ruling of the Mishnah comes from verses in the Torah.
- However, [[there is something difficult about saying Rashi is merely bothered by the question of the source for the Mishnah]].

There is something difficult about saying Rashi is merely bothered by the question of the source for the Mishnah:
Let's imagine Rashi is merely bothered by the scriptural source for the ruling of the Mishnah, so he came to tell you the Gemara would later derive it from verses.
- If so, any time the Gemara will later give a source for a ruling of the Mishnah, [[what might we expect Rashi to say on the Mishnah?]]

What might we expect Rashi to say on the Mishnah?
We might expect that Rashi will always say on the Mishnah that the Gemara is going to explain the source of the ruling.
- [[Do we find that Rashi does this?]]

Do we find that Rashi does this?
No, we don't find that Rashi always telling us on the Mishnah that the Gemara will explain the Mishnah's source, even though the Gemara often does.
- Additionally, we generally say that Rashi comments when something is confusing.
- [[Is it _confusing_ to see a ruling of the Mishnah and not know the Gemara will later derive it from verses?]]

Is it _confusing_ to see a ruling of the Mishnah and not know the Gemara will later derive it from verses?
It doesn't seem confusing. You might be _curious_ as to what the source is, but why doesn't Rashi just let you read ahead in the Gemara?
- [[What is so confusing about this Mishnah that Rashi can't just let us read on in the Gemara for the Mishnah's source?]]

What is so confusing about this Mishnah that Rashi can't just let us read on in the Gemara for the Mishnah's source?
And one last problem – [[why do I even need Rashi?]]

Why do I even need Rashi?
Rashi is telling me the Mishnah comes from verses.
- [[What else would I have thought without Rashi?]]

What else would I have thought without Rashi?
Where else would a Mishnah be coming from except verses?
- Doesn't the Gemara always explain the scriptural sources of Mishnas?
- Isn't it obvious that the Gemara is going to explain which verses the Mishnah comes from?
- [[What is Rashi doing here?]]

What is Rashi doing here?
Is there a reason here specifically we would need Rashi to comment?
- [[Can we think of a difference between this ruling and other rulings in the Mishnah that would make it more confusing?]]

Can we think of a difference between this ruling and other rulings in the Mishnah that would make it more confusing?
Is there a reason here specifically Rashi would need to tell me the ruling comes from verses?
- [[Why might the ruling of _shlichus_ be uniquely confusing to the reader?]]

Why might the ruling of _shlichus_ be uniquely confusing to the reader?
Let's say the Mishnah discusses the details of a _Sukkah_.
- [[Could you find the verse in the Torah that it was referring to?]]

Could you find the verse in the Torah that it was referring to?
Probably yes. [[What about if the Mishnah explained the details of _shofar_?]]

What about if the Mishnah explained the details of _shofar_?
You could probably find the verse in the Torah.
- [[What about _shlichus_?]]

What about _shlichus_?
It would seem there is no explicit verse in the Torah teaching slichus.
- So, [[what is so confusing about the Mishnah that Rashi has to tell me now that the Gemara will derive the ruling from verses?]]

What is so confusing about the Mishnah that Rashi has to tell me now that the Gemara will derive the ruling from verses?
The answer may be, by _shlichus_ specifically you wouldn't be sure what verses the Mishnah is coming from.
[[You might think the Mishnah isn't coming from verses at all]].

You might think the Mishnah isn't coming from verses at all:
So, [[you would have a pretty big difficulty with the Mishnah]].

You would have a pretty big difficulty with the Mishnah:
[[You might not be able to wait until the Gemara for an answer]].

You might not be able to wait until the Gemara for an answer:
So, that might be what is bothering Rashi!
