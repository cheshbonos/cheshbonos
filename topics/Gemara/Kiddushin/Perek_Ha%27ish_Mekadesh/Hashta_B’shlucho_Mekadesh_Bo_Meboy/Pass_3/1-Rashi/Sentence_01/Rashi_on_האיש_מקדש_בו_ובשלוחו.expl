Translate Rashi's answer:

What is bothering Rashi?
Rashi is telling us the Gemara will later explain the scriptural source for the first ruling of the Mishnah.
- If so, [[what question does Rashi think I have right now?]] (Think before clicking!)

What question does Rashi think I have right now?
Perhaps Rashi wants the reader to know that the ruling of the Mishnah comes from verses in the Torah.
- However, [[there is something difficult about saying Rashi is merely bothered by the question of the source for the Mishnah]].

There is something difficult about saying Rashi is merely bothered by the question of the source for the Mishnah:
Let's imagine Rashi is merely bothered by the scriptural source for the ruling of the Mishnah, so he came to tell you the Gemara would later derive it from verses.
- If so, any time the Gemara will later give a source for a ruling of the Mishnah, [[what might we expect Rashi to say on the Mishnah?]]

What might we expect Rashi to say on the Mishnah?
We might expect that Rashi will always say on the Mishnah that the Gemara is going to explain the source of the ruling.
- [[Do we find that Rashi does this?]]

Do we find that Rashi does this?
No, we don't find that Rashi always telling us on the Mishnah that the Gemara will explain the Mishnah's source, even though the Gemara often does.
- Additionally, we generally say that Rashi comments when something is confusing.
- [[Is it _confusing_ to see a Mishnah and not know the Gemara will later derive it from verses?]]

Is it _confusing_ to see a Mishnah and not know the Gemara will later derive it from verses?
It doesn't seem confusing. You might be _curious_ as to what the source is, but why doesn't Rashi just let you read ahead in the Gemara?
- [[What is so confusing that Rashi can't just let us read on in the Gemara for the Mishnah's source?]]

What is so confusing that Rashi can't just let us read on in the Gemara for the Mishnah's source?
Can we think of a difference between this ruling and other rulings in the Mishnah?
- [[Why might the ruling of _shlichus_ be uniquely confusing to the reader?]]

Why might the ruling of _shlichus_ be uniquely confusing to the reader?
Let's say the Mishnah discusses the details of a _Sukkah_.
- [[Could you find the verse in the Torah that it was referring to?]]

Could you find the verse in the Torah that it was referring to?
Probably yes. [[What about if the Mishnah explained the details of _shofar_?]]

What about if the Mishnah explained the details of _shofar_?
You could probably find the verse in the Torah.
- [[What about _shlichus_?]]

What about _shlichus_?
It would seem there is no explicit verse in the Torah teaching slichus.
- So, [[what is so confusing about the Mishnah that Rashi has to tell me now that the Gemara will derive the ruling from verses?]]

What is so confusing about the Mishnah that Rashi has to tell me now that the Gemara will derive the ruling from verses?
The answer may be, by _shlichus_ specifically I'm not sure what verses the Mishnah is coming from.
- I might think the Mishnah isn't coming from verses at all.
- So, I would have a pretty big difficulty with the Mishnah
- I might not be able to wait until the Gemara for an answer
- So that difficulty might be what is bothering Rashi
- 🎉
