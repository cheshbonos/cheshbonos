Second pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
On the second pass, lets consider further questions we might have with this line:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
- (You can [[First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו|review the literal meaning of the line if you need to first]].)
- Think for yourself, and then consider these [[hints]]. (Think before clicking!)

Hints:
This clause of the Mishnah teaches that there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman.
- [[What questions might we have on {there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman|that}]]? (Think before clicking!)

What questions might we have on there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman:
R Yehuda HaNasi was the compiler of the Mishnah.
- We might ask, [[what did {R Yehuda HaNasi|he} put in {The Mishnah|it}?]]

What did R Yehuda HaNasi put in The Mishnah?
When R Yehuda HaNasi was writing the Mishnah, [[did {R Yehuda HaNasi|he} just write his personal opinions about various things?]]

Did R Yehuda HaNasi just write his personal opinions about various things?
Let's remember that when R Yehuda HaNasi wrote the Mishnah, he was encoding the oral understandings of Torah that had existed long before him.
- Lets see if [[{the fact that the Mishnah encodes the oral law|that} helps us think of a question on this Mishnah]].

The fact that the Mishnah encodes the oral law helps us think of a question on this Mishnah:
We might ask tangentially, [[what sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?]]

What sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?
Generally, we say that the Oral Torah contains the details of the mitzvos that Hashem chose not to put in the written Torah.
- If so, [[what is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?]]

What is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?
You might say:
- If the Oral Torah is for details of mitzvos mentioned in the written Torah, then perhaps we wouldn't expect the Oral Torah to include any mitzvos or details of mitzvos that aren't mentioned in the written Torah.
- [[Does the fact that the Oral Torah doesn't include mitzvos not written in the Torah help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that the Oral Torah doesn't include mitzvos not written in the Torah help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
So we have established thus far:
- The Oral Torah and thus the Mishnah are elaborating on what is written in the written Torah.
- Our Mishnah speaks about a man being allowed to make _kiddushin_ via a shaliach.
- [[Can we connect the Oral Torah elaborating on the written Torah with the din of the Mishnah?|Can we think of a question yet?]]

Can we connect the Oral Torah elaborating on the written Torah with the din of the Mishnah?
If the Oral Torah and thus the Mishnah only teaches the details of mitzvos mentioned in the written Torah, then perhaps we would expect things written in the Mishnah to relate to something written in the _Chumash_.
- [[Does the fact that things in the Mishnah should relate to something in the _chumash_ give us a question about this Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that things in the Mishnah should relate to something in the _chumash_ give us a question about this Mishnah?
So, the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which contains details of the things written in the written Torah.
- As another hint, our Mishnah is the first Mishnah to mention the idea that you can use a _shaliach_ to do a mitzvah.
- [[Does the fact that this Mishnah is the first to mention that you can use a _shaliach_ help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does the fact that this Mishnah is the first to mention that you can use a _shaliach_ help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
We said that the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which includes details of halachos written in the written Torah.
- We said that our Mishnah is the first to mention that you can do a mitzvah via _shaliach_.
- We also said the Mishnah is transmitting the Oral Law which merely ellaborates on what is said in the written Torah.
- So, a question we might have is, [[where in the _written_ Torah do we find a source for the ability to use a _shaliach_?]]

Where in the _written_ Torah do we find a source for the ability to use a _shaliach_?
[[Now, what if I told you there was no such verse?]]

Now, what if I told you there was no such verse?
Then, you might have a good question on the Mishnah:
- “Where is the Mishnah getting the concept of _shlichus_ from if there is no such verse explicit in the Torah”
- 🎉🎉🎉
