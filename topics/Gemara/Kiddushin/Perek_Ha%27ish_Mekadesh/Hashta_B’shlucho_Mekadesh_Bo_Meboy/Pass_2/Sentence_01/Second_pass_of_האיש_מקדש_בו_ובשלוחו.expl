Second pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
On the second pass, lets consider further questions we might have with this line:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
- (You can [[First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו|review the literal meaning of the line if you need to first]].)
- Think for yourself, and then [[consider these hints]]. (Think before clicking!)

Consider these Hints:
This clause of the Mishnah teaches that there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman.
- [[What questions might we have on {there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman|that}]]? (Think before clicking!)

What questions might we have on there are two permissible ways for a man to be _makdesh_ a woman:
Let's think. R Yehuda HaNasi was the compiler of the Mishnah.
- We might ask, [[what sorts of things did R Yehuda HaNasi put in The Mishnah?]]

What sorts of things did R Yehuda HaNasi put in The Mishnah?
When R Yehuda HaNasi was writing the Mishnah, [[did {R Yehuda HaNasi|he} just write his personal opinions about various things?]]

Did R Yehuda HaNasi just write his personal opinions about various things?
Let's remember that when R Yehuda HaNasi wrote the Mishnah, he was encoding the oral understandings of Torah that had existed long before him.
- Lets see if [[{the fact that the Mishnah encodes the Oral Torah helps us think of a question on this Mishnah]].

The fact that the Mishnah encodes the Oral Torah helps us think of a question on this Mishnah:
We might ask tangentially, [[what sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?]]

What sorts of things are in the Oral Torah?
Generally, we say that the Oral Torah contains the details of mitzvos we find in the written Torah.
- If so, [[what is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?]]

What is something you wouldn't find in the Oral Torah?
Perhaps we wouldn't expect the Oral Torah to discuss things we've never heard about from the written Torah.
- [[Does the fact the Oral Torah discusses the written Torah specifically help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does the fact the Oral Torah discusses the written Torah specifically help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
So we have established thus far:
- The Mishnah includes the Oral Torah.
- The Oral Torah elaborates on what is in the written Torah.
- Our Mishnah speaks about a man being allowed to make _kiddushin_ via a shaliach.
- [[Can we think of a question yet?]]

Can we think of a question yet?
Perhaps we would expect things written in the Mishnah to relate to something written in the Torah.
- [[Does this give us a question about our Mishnah?]]

Does this give us a question about our Mishnah?
So, the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which contains details of the things written in the written Torah.
- As another hint, our Mishnah is the first Mishnah to mention the idea that you can use a _shaliach_ to do a mitzvah.
- [[Does this help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?]]

Does this help us formulate a question on our Mishnah?
We said that the Mishnah encodes the Oral Law which includes details of halachos written in the written Torah.
- We said that our Mishnah is the first to mention that you can do a mitzvah via _shaliach_.
- So, a question we might have is, [[where in the _written_ Torah do we find a source for the ability to use a _shaliach_?]]

Where in the _written_ Torah do we find a source for the ability to use a _shaliach_?
[[Can you think of any verses that say you can use a _shaliach_?]]

Can you think of any verses that say you can use a _shaliach_?
[[Think very hard]].

Think very hard:
[[Now, what if I told you there was no such verse?]]

Now, what if I told you there was no such verse?
Then, you might have a good question on the Mishnah!
- “Where is the Mishnah getting the concept of using a _shaliach_ from, if there is no such verse explicit in the Torah?”
- 🎉🎉🎉
