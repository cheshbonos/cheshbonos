The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
This is the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
It has a [[first clause]], a [[second clause]], and a [[third clause]].

First clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
This is the first clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the first clause]], a [[literal translation of the first clause]], a [[pshat in the first clause]], and [[Gemaras on the first clause]].

Gemaras on the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].

Words of the first clause: The first clause of the Mishnah includes [[the word האיש]], [[the word מקדש]], [[the word בו]], and [[the word ובשלוחו]].

The word האיש: The word האיש is composed of [[the word איש]] and [[the prefix ה]].

The word איש: This is the noun "man".

The prefix ה: This is the word "the".

The word מקדש: מקדש ("mekadesh") is the [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]] of [[the shoresh קדש]].

The word בו: This is the prefix ב with a third-person masculine conjugation.

The word ובשלוחו: This is the prefix ו, followed by the prefix ב, followed by the word שלוח, followed by the suffix ו.

Literal translation of the first clause: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal translation might be:
> The man is being mekadesh, with himself or with a shaliach
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does it say _the_ man?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does it say _the_ man? [[It seems as though the Mishnah should not use the word "the"]], but [[perhaps the Mishnah uses the word "the" because of the prior Mishnah]].

It seems as though the Mishnah should not use the word "the": If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Perhaps the Mishnah uses the word "the" because of the prior Mishnah: Perhaps we can say that this Mishnah is following the first Mishnah of the masechta, which spoke about ways "the woman" is niknas, and so maybe the "the" in "the woman" and the "the" in "the man" are being used to exclude one another - "_the_ woman" (as opposed to the man in the interaction,) and "_the_ man" (as opposed to the woman in the interaction.)

Pshat in the first clause: A pshat in the first clause of the Mishna might be:
> A man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh a woman, himself or with a shaliach

Second clause:
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
This is the second clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the second clause]], a [[literal translation of the second clause]], and a [[pshat in the second clause]].

Words of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the second clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the second clause: This is a work in progress.


Third clause:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
This is the third clause of the Mishnah. You can read about the [[words of the third clause]], a [[literal translation of the third clause]], and a [[pshat in the third clause]].

Words of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Literal translation of the third clause: This is a work in progress.

Pshat in the third clause: This is a work in progress.
