The mishnah on Kiddushin 41a: The mishnah on Kiddushin 41a, printed below, has [[three clauses]].
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Three clauses: The Mishnah on 41a has a [[first clause]], a [[second clause]], and a [[third clause]].

First clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
This is the first clause of the Mishna. You can read about the [[words of the first clause]], a [[literal translation of the first clause]], and a [[pshat in the first clause]]. The first clause is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].

Words of the first clause: The first clause includes [[the word ha'ish]], [[the word mekadesh]], [[the word bo]], and [[the word u'b'shlucho]].

The word ha'ish: The word ha'ish (האיש) is composed of [[the word ish]] and [[the prefix hay]].

The word ish:

The prefix hay:

The word mekadesh: "Mekadesh" (מקדש) is the [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]] of [[the shoresh קדש]].

The word bo:

The word u'b'shlucho:

Literal translation of the first clause: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal translation might be:
> The man is being mekadesh, with himself or with an emissary
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does ha'ish have a hay ha'yedia?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does ha'ish have a hay ha'yedia? [[It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a hay ha'yedia]], but [[perhaps the Mishnah uses the hay ha'yedia because of the Mishnah it is following]].

It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a hay ha'yedia: If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Perhaps the Mishnah uses the hay ha'yedia because of the Mishnah it is following: Perhaps we can say that this Mishnah is following the first Mishnah of the masechta, which spoke about ways "the woman" is niknas, and so maybe the "the" in "the woman" and the "the" in "the man" are being used to exclude one another - "_the_ woman" (as opposed to the man in the interaction,) and "_the_ man" (as opposed to the woman in the interaction.)

Pshat in the first clause: A pshat in the first clause of the Mishna might be:
> A man is allowed to be mekadesh an isha, himself or with a shaliach

Second clause: The second clause reads:
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה


Third clause: The third clause reads:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
