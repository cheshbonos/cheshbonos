Cheshbonos: This is a beta version of Cheshbonos, a tool for improving Gemara skills. At the moment Cheshbonos offers help in learning [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]]. You can navigate by using the mouse or arrow keys. Cheshbonos is published with various [[disclaimers]]. You can post your questions or comments on the [issues page](https://github.com/cheshbonos/cheshbonos/issues). Sign up for occasional [[email updates]]. Cheshbonos is built using [Canopy.js](https://github.com/canopy-js/canopy-js).

Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such persons should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for people who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning. Cheshbonos can be downloaded and used without an internet connection, and the website does not represent an endorsement of internet use.
