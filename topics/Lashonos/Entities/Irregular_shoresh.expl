Irregular shoresh: An irregular shoresh, as opposed to a [[regular shoresh]], is a [[shoresh]] that has special letters that affect the vowelization of verbs produced from that shoresh. A common example is a shoresh that has a י in the first position, such as ישב, where the י will often becomes a ו in verb forms that have prefixes, for example having מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv_) instead of the more typical מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv_), which might be harder to pronounce.
