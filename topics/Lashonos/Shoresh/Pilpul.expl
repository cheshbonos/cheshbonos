Pilpul: The _pilpul_ is a form where a weak shoresh with only two strong letters (eg טול) or a shoresh with a repeated second letter (eg לחח) has the first and last letters doubled to produce a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif'el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| טול | to move | טלטל | to teeter about |
| לחח | to be moist | לחלח | to moisten |
| בלל | to mix | בלבל | to confuse |
| משׁשׁ | to touch | משׁמשׁ | to examine physically |
The meaning of the _pilpul_ form is often a more repetitive version of the meaning of the two-letter form. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _pilpul_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi'el_]], [[_pu'al_]], and [[_hispa'el_]] forms.
