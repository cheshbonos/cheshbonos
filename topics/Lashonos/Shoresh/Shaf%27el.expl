Shaf'el: The _shaf'el_ form is a special type of [[four-letter shor{ushim|esh}]].
- It is produced by taking a shoresh like עבד and adding a ש to the front to produce a new shoresh like שעבד.
- A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf'el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]
- A shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf'el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh*  | *_Shif'el_ Shoresh* | *Notes* |
| עבד <br> work | שעבד <br> subjugate<br> (to make someone else work) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| זרע <br> seeding | שזרע <br> reseeding (causing to become seeded) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| נוע <br> moving | שנע <br> transporting (causing to move) | This is a "weak" shoresh with only two strong letters, and it becomes a three letter shoresh |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf'el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi'el_]], [[_pu'al_]], and [[_hispa'el_]] forms.
