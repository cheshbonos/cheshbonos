Shaf'el: The _shaf'el_ form is when a shoresh like עבד gets a ש added to the front to produce a new shoresh שעבד. A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf'el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]] and a shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf'el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif'el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| עבד | work | שעבד | subjugate (to make someone else work) |
| זרע | seeding | שזרע | reseeding (causing to become seeded) |
| נוע | moving | שנע | transporting (causing to move) |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf'el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi'el_]], [[_pu'al_]], and [[_hispa'el_]] forms.
