Four-letter shorushim: While most shorushim have three letters, and some arguably have two letters, sometimes we see shorushim that seem to have four distinct letters, like שבעד meaning subjugation, or טלטל meaning movement. These shorushim only have verbs in the "heavy" binyanim like the _pi'el_ because the doubled middle letter creates room for four consonant sounds, and the four letters of the root use those gaps:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *[[_Pi'el_]] example* | *Transliteration* |
|-|-|-|-|
| דבר | speech | מְדַבֵּר | _me<b>d</b>a<b>b</b>'<b>b</b>e<b>r</b>_ |
| שעבד | subjugation | מְשַׁעְבֵּד | _me<b>sh</b>a'<b>a</b>-<b>b</b>ei<b>d</b>_ |
| טלטל | movement | לְטַלְטֵל | _me<b>t</b>a<b>l</b>'<b>t</b>e<b>l</b>_ |
Four letter shorushim often are produced from regular shorushim via certain rules, such as in the [[_shaf'el_]] and the [[_pilpul_]] forms.
