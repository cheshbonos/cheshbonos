Pi'el: The "pi'el" (פִּעֵל), also known as the Hebrew active intensive binyan, is a [[binyan]] that exists in Hebrew corresponding to the [[{{_pa'el_}} in Aramaic]]. It is called the "intensive" because shorushim that are converted into verbs by putting them in the intensive often assume a meaning that is a more "intense" version of the idea that is represented by the shoresh itself. [Add example].
