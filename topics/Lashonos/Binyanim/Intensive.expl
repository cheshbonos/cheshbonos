Intensive: There are several [["intensive" binyanim]] in Hebrew and Aramaic. They are called "intensive" because the verbs that are produced by putting shorushim in those binyanim often assume a meaning that is a more "intense" or repetitive version of the idea that is represented by the shoresh itself. For example, the shoresh שבר expresses the general idea of things breaking, whereas the _pi'el_ verb of שבר,‎ לְשַׁבֵּר, means "to shatter."

"Intensive" binyanim: There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic, in Hebrew the [[active {{_pi'el_}}]] and the [[passive {{pu'al}}]], and in Aramaic the [[active {{pa'el}}]] and the [[passive {{ispa'al}}]].
