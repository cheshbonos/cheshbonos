Intensive-active binyan: The intensive-active binyan, also known as the "pi'el" (פִּעֵל) in Hebrew, is a [[binyan]] that exists in Hebrew and Aramaic. It is called the "intensive" because shorushim that are converted into verbs by putting them in the intensive often assume a meaning that is a more "intense" version of the idea that is represented by the shoresh itself. [Add example].
