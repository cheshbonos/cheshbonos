Binyan: "Binyan" is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English. Binyanim are [[related to shorushim]]. There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].

Related to shorushim: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, a _binyan_ of that shoresh would represent a specific verb or adjective within that range of meaning. A shoresh like קדש might have the general meaning "holiness" whereas a particular binyan of that shoresh might produce the specific verb "to make something holy," or "to be holy."
