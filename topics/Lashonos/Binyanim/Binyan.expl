Binyan: "Binyan" is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English. A binyan is a category of verb that shares meaning and appearance. [[A shoresh is put "into" a binyan to produce a word]]. There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].

A shoresh is put "into" a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל "to eat," לְהַאֲכִיל "to feed," or adjective אָכוּל "eaten."
