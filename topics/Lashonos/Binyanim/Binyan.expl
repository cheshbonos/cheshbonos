Binyan: "Binyan" is [[a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic]]. There are [[seven binyanim]].

A grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, a _binyan_ takes a _shoresh_ and instantiates the _shoresh's_ general meaning into a specific verb or adjective. A shoresh like קדש might have the general meaning of "holiness" whereas a particular binyan of that shoresh might produce the specific verb "to make something holy," or "to be holy."
