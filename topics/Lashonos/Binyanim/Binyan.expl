Binyan: "Binyan" is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English.
- A verb is a [[shoresh]] that is put into a particular binyan.
- A binyan functions [[like a flavor of the shoresh]].
- Every binyan is a combination of [[five basic types of action]].
- There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].
- There are also [[nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim]].

Like a flavor of the shoresh: You can think of a binyan as being a "flavor" of meaning that gets mixed with the shoresh to produce different verbs. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Binyan* | *Binyan Meaning* | *Resulting Verb* |
| אכל <br> eating | [[_hif'il_]] | causing someone else<br> to do something | causing + eating = <br> to feed |
| כתב <br> writing | [[_pi'el_]] | doing something<br> more intensely | writing + intense = <br> to engrave |
| קנה <br> buying | [[_nif'al_]] | having something<br> done to you | buying + <br>something done to you = <br> to be purchased |
English by comparison [[uses alternative means to achieve the same effect]].

Five basic types of action: There are five "types" of action that get combined to produce different binyanim:
- [[Active]]: Someone doing something themselves
- [[Passive]]: Someone having something done to them
- [[Simple]]: Someone doing a very straight-forward version of an action
- [[Intensive]]: Someone doing an intense or repetitive version of an action
- [[Causative]]: Someone causing someone else do an action
All of the different [[Hebrew Binyanim|binyanim of Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic Binyanim|of Aramaic]] are different combinations of these five ideas. For example, the [[_hif'il_]] is active, and causative.

Uses alternative means to achieve the same effect: In English, we do not use "binyan" to produce families of related verbs. Rather, we [[make larger verbs out of multiple words]], and [[use entirely separate words for related concepts]].

Nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim: Every verb has one binyan, and there are nouns and adjectives that come from a verb in a particular binyan.
- For example, from every _pi'el_ verb you can produce a _pi'el_ noun with the same meaning by using [[the _kittul_ noun pattern]].

Make larger verbs out of multiple words: In English, you have one simple verb like "eat," and then you can add other words to form larger ideas like "he made someone eat," or "he was eaten," etc, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of these permutations will be entirely different one-word verbs with similar spellings because they are formed from the same [[shoresh]] root.

Use entirely separate words for related concepts: In English, words that have related meanings do not necessarily look similar. For example, you might have verbs like "buy" and "sell" that have related meanings but no visual similarity, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, a word like "to buy" (לִקְנוֹת) and word like "to sell" (לְהִיקָּנוֹת) would be verbs formed from two different binyans of the same [[shoresh]] קנה, and so will have a similar spelling.

A shoresh is put "into" a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל "to eat," לְהַאֲכִיל "to feed," or adjective אָכוּל "eaten."
