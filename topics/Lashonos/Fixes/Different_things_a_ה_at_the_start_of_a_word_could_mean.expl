Different things a ה at the start of a word could mean: The letter ה at the start of a word could mean several things.
- A ה at the start of a word might be part of the actual word, for example the ה in הֶֽבֶל which means vapor or emptiness.
- A ה at the start of a word might be the Hebrew version of the word "the" in English, for example הַאֶבֶן, "the rock," formed from the word אֶבֶן, meaning "rock."
- A ה at the start of a word might be part of a certain kind of past tense Hebrew verb that begins with a ה prefix. For example, the [[shoresh]] אכל can sometimes produce a past tense verb like הֶאֱכִיל. If this is the reason for the ה at the beginning of the word, there will usually be a י between the third and fifth letters, like in הֶאֱכִיל, although sometimes the י will be between the second and fourth letter, in a verb like הִפִּיל "he dropped." (For more advanced readers, this verb form is called the [[_hif'il_]].)
