Hebrew noun patterns: There are certain vowel templates that accept shorushim and produce nouns. Noun patterns [[have a naming convention]]. These are some of the noun patterns in Hebrew:
- [[the _hektel_ pattern]]
- [[the _haktala_ pattern]]
- [[the _hiskattlut_ pattern]]

Have a naming convention: Noun patterns are named by putting the shoresh קטל into the given pattern, the same way that binyan names are formed by putting the shoresh פעל into the third-person masculine past-tense form of that binyan.
