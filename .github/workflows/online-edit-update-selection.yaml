        # In theory the user should be able to keep editing the bulk file and each time
        # have it build the topics files on main from it, but if the user makes a new file
        # in one commit and then removes it in another commit, the .canopy_bulk_original_selection
        # file will not list it, and so the removal will not register as an intentional deletion,
        # and so after each bulk file edit we have to update the selection dotfile, like in sync mode,
        # so that additional changes to the file are interpreted by contrast to the most recent verison of the file.
