[Lashonos/Expressions]

* Ika d'amri: The phrase "ika d'amri" (איכא דאמי) is an Aramaic phrase used in Gemara, literally meaning "there are those who say." Ika d'amri is used by the Gemara to introduce multiple versions of a section of Gemara, which are sometimes called [["Lishna"|lishnas]].


[Lashonos/Shorushim]

* The shoresh בעה: "בעה" is a shoresh in Aramaic that can mean "requesting", "searching" or "needing".


* The shoresh קדש: "קדש" is a shoresh in Hebrew and Aramaic that has various meanings that involve the concept of "holiness." It has simple, [[intensive]], causative, and reflexive forms.

Intensive: The intensive form of the shoresh קדש appears in both Hebrew and Aramaic. There is a [[meaning of the intensive]], and there are [[forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic: There are [[forms of the intensive of in Hebrew]] and forms of the intensive in Aramaic.

Forms of the intensive of in Hebrew: There is an intensive past tense, a [[Hebrew intensive participial tense]], an intensive future tense, an intensive command tense, and an intensive infinitive tense.

Hebrew intensive participial tense: There is a [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]], a Hebrew feminine singular participial, a Hebrew masculine plural participial, and a Hebrew feminine plural participial.

Hebrew masculine singular participial: The Hebrew masculine singular participial of the shoresh "קדש" is מְקַדֵּשׁ, pronounced "mekadesh."

Meaning of the intensive: It means "to produce a stage called _kiddushin_ between a man and a woman." Kiddushin is a stage prior to full marriage (called nisuyin) in which the woman is halachically designated to the man.


[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].


[Talmud Bavli]

* Talmud Bavli: The Talmud Bavli is a commentary on the Mishnah. Talmud Bavli [[follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah]].

Follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah: There is Talmud Bavli on Seder Moed, [[Seder Nashim]], Seder Nezikin, Seder Kodashim, and Seder Tahoros.

Seder Nashim: Seder Nashim of Talmud Bavli includes Yevamot, Ketubot, Nedarim, Nazir, Sotah, Gittin, and [[Maseches Kiddushin|Kiddushin]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin]

[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a]

* Kiddushin 41a: Kiddushin 41a is an amud from [[Maseches Kiddushin]], and is the first amud of [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]]. It contains the sugya [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].


* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a: The mishnah on Kiddushin 41a has a [[full text]], and [[three dinim]].

Full text: The full text of the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a reads:
> האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Three dinim: The Mishnah on 41a has a [[first din]], a [[second din]], and a [[third din]].

First din: The first din of the Mishnah is quoted below. You can read about the [[words of the first din]], a [[literal translation of the first din]], and a [[psht in the first din]]. The first din is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].
> האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו

Words of the first din: The first din includes [[the word ha'ish]], [[the word mekadesh]], [[the word bo]], and [[the word u'b'shlucho]].

The word ha'ish: The word ha'ish (האיש) is composed of [[the word ish]] and [[the prefix hay]].

The word ish:

The prefix hay:

The word mekadesh: "Mekadesh" (מקדש) is the [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]] of [[the shoresh קדש]].

The word bo:

The word u'b'shlucho:

Literal translation of the first din: Once we identify what each of the words of the first din of the Mishnah mean in context, a literal translation might be:
> A man is being mekadesh, with himself or with an emissary
Try to figure out what this means in context, then ask [[what does "being mekadesh" mean here?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" means a psak, and so "the man is mekadesh" means "a man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh."

Psht in the first din:

Second din: The second din reads:
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה


Third din: The third din reads:
> האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

* Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya: _Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ is the first sugya in [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]] appearing on [[Kiddushin 41a]]. It discusses the [[first din]] of [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]] You can read the sugya's [[full text]], and learn the sugya's various [[parts]], and can review with an outside [[summary]].

Full text: The full text of the sugya _hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ reads:
> גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא אמר
> רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
> ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא
> איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
> כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
> אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
> עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
> ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
> כמוך וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
> בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף

> מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
> איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
> למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו

Parts: The sugya of _hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ discusses [the first din of the mishnah on Kedushin 41a], and begins with an [[opening kasha]], followed by [[two lishnas of the Gemara's terutz]].

Opening kasha: The sugya of _hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ begins with a opening kasha, quoted below. You can read about the [[words of the opening kasha]], a [[literal translation of the opening kasha]], a [[pshat in the opening kasha]], and hear [[ha'aras on the opening kasha]].
> [גמ'] השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא [אמר]

Words of the opening kasha:
The text of the opening kasha is composed of the word [["hashta"]], [[the word "b'shlucho"]], [[the word "mekadesh"]], [[the word "bo"]], and [[the word "meboya"]].

The word "b'shlucho":

The word "mekadesh":

The word "bo":

The word "meboya":

Literal translation of the opening kasha: Once we know what the individual words mean in this context, a literal (but unclear) translation of the opening kasha would be:
> "Now that with his agent he is mekadesh, with himself is needed."
Try to figure out what this might mean, then you can ask the following questions: [[What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here?]] [[What does 'with himself' mean here?]] [[What does "is needed" mean here?]]

What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here? You might wonder what the words "with his agent he is mekadesh" (בשלוחו מקדש) mean. They are a reference to the Mishnah, which said that a man can be mekadesh with his agent.

What does 'with himself' mean here? You might ask what does the word "with himself" (בו) means in the sentence "with himself is needed". "With himself" is a quotation from the Mishnah, and so the subject of the sentence is the word "בו", and the literal translation of the Gemara is that it is saying "the word בו in the Mishnah is needed".

What does "is needed" mean here? The Gemara uses the phrase "is needed" (מיבעיא), from [[the shoresh בעה]], to speak about words in the Mishnah and to speak about why each one is necessary.

Pshat in the opening kasha: The opening kasha seems to be asking: now that the Mishnah has taught us that a man can be mekadesh via his agent, then I already know by implication that the lesser chiddush that he can be mekadesh himself is true, so why did the Mishnah have to teach it to me?

Ha'aras on the opening kasha: From the opening kasha, we see certain assumptions the Gemara is making about the Mishnah.

Two lishnas of the Gemara's terutz: After the opening kasha, the Gemara gives a [[first lishna]], and a [[second lishna]]. ([["Lishna"|What is a "lishna"?]])

First lishna: The first lishna is an answer to the Gemara's kasha, quoted below. The first lishna is composed of the [[amira of R Yosef]] and [[ha d'Rav Safra]].
> [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
> רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
> ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא

Amira of R Yosef: The amira of R Yosef follows the Gemara's kasha and is the first portion of the first lishna, quoted below.
> [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
> רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו [כי הא דרב]

Ha d'Rav Safra: The section "ha d'Rav Safra" follows the amira of R Yosef, quoted below. You can read about the [[words of ha d'Rav Safra]]
> כי הא דרב [רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו]
> ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא

Words of ha d'Rav Safra: The section "ha d'Rav Safra" includes the word ki, the word ha, the phrase d'Rav Safra, the word machrich, the word reisha, the word Rava, the word malach, and the word shibuta.

Second lishna: The second lishna goes from the phrase "ika d'amri" until the two dots that end the sugya, quoted below.
> איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
> כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
> אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
> עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
> ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
> כמוך וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
> בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
> מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
> מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
> איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
> למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו
