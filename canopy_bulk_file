Disclaimers: Cheshbonos is published without expert endorsement and is a product of novice efforts. Persons wishing to improve their Gemara skills who have the resources should enroll in a full-time yeshiva program. Short of that, such persons should find a Gemara rebbe with whom they can form a relationship and learn from directly. Cheshbonos is intended for people who lack these resources, or as a tool for reviewing content already learned in a yeshiva setting. Individuals should ask their communal rabbinic advisors if Cheshbonos is the appropriate tool for their learning.

[Lashonos/Expressions]

* Ika d'amri: The phrase "ika d'amri" (איכא דאמי) is an Aramaic phrase used in Gemara, literally meaning "there are those who say." Ika d'amri is used by the Gemara to introduce multiple versions of a section of Gemara, which are sometimes called [["Lishna"|lishnas]].


[Lashonos/Grammar]

* Hebrew nouns: Hebrew has various types of nouns. Hebrew nouns [[by default have an indefinite article]], or they can have a hay ha'yedia, which is the definite article.

By default have an indefinite article: The Hebrew word איש, for example, means "a man", not just "man" and there is no specific word in Hebrew for "a".


[Lashonos/Shorushim]

* The shoresh בעה: "בעה" is a shoresh in Aramaic that can mean "requesting", "searching" or "needing".


* The shoresh קדש: "קדש" is a shoresh in Hebrew and Aramaic that has various meanings that involve the concept of "holiness." It has simple, [[intensive]], causative, and reflexive forms.

Intensive: The intensive form of the shoresh קדש appears in both Hebrew and Aramaic. There is a [[meaning of the intensive]], and there are [[forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Forms of the intensive in Hebrew and Aramaic: There are [[forms of the intensive of in Hebrew]] and forms of the intensive in Aramaic.

Forms of the intensive of in Hebrew: There is an intensive past tense, a [[Hebrew intensive participial tense]], an intensive future tense, an intensive command tense, and an intensive infinitive tense.

Hebrew intensive participial tense: There is a [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]], a Hebrew feminine singular participial, a Hebrew masculine plural participial, and a Hebrew feminine plural participial.

Hebrew masculine singular participial: The Hebrew masculine singular participial of the shoresh "קדש" is מְקַדֵּשׁ, pronounced "mekadesh."

Meaning of the intensive: It means "to produce a stage called _kiddushin_ between a man and a woman." Kiddushin is a stage prior to full marriage (called nisuyin) in which the woman is halachically designated to the man.


[Lashonos/Terms]

* "Hashta": "Hashta" (השתא) is an Aramaic adverb literally meaning "now," but which is often used in the Gemara to introduce a seeming contradiction or oddity that emerges _"now"_ that we have learned something else, representing a statement similar to "_now_ that you've told me X, how can the text say Y?"


* "Lishna": [[What is the literal definition of "lishna"?]] [[What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara?]]

What is the literal definition of "lishna"? "Lishna" (לשנא) is an Aramaic term that literally means "tounge" or "language", like the word לשן in Hebrew.

What does "lishna" mean when speaking about Gemara? The word "lishna" is used in the Rishonim and after to refer to one of multiple versions of an Amoritic exchange that is brought in the Gemara. ([[How can there be multiple versions of the text?]] [[Is one version wrong?]]) The term is used to [[distinguish between different lishnas]].

How can there be multiple versions of the text? Some explain that there were different traditions of what the Amoriam said, and so the compilers of the Gemara included both versions.

Is one version wrong? There seems to be a strong presumption among Rishonim and Achronim that all lishnas offered by the Gemara are reasonable, and differ on subtle points and not mere accidents of transmission.

Use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts: Sometimes it is not clear at what point in the text the "first lishna" began, ie what portion of the text the "ika d'amri" is a second version _of_, and so sometimes one has to look at what question the second lishna is answering, and then find where in the first lishna this question is answered, and then one can infer that this is the start of the first lishna.

Distinguish between different lishnas: The first version of the Gemara is usually called the "lishna kama" (לשמא קמא) ie the first version, and the second version is usually called the "lishna basra" (לשנא בשרא) ie the "later version," which is also sometimes called "the ika d'amri" (איכא דאמרי), due to the fact that second versions are often introduced with the phrase [[ika d'amri]]. Sometimes the reader must [[use the second lishna to determine where the first lishna starts]].


[Talmud Bavli]

* Talmud Bavli: The Talmud Bavli is a commentary on the Mishnah. Talmud Bavli [[follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah]].

Follows the six sedarim of the Mishnah: There is Talmud Bavli on Seder Moed, [[Seder Nashim]], Seder Nezikin, Seder Kodashim, and Seder Tahoros.

Seder Nashim: Seder Nashim of Talmud Bavli includes Yevamot, Ketubot, Nedarim, Nazir, Sotah, Gittin, and [[Maseches Kiddushin|Kiddushin]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin]

* Maseches Kiddushin: Maseches Kiddushin is a masechta of [[Seder Nashim]] in [[Talmud Bavli]]. It has several [[perakim]].

Perakim: The first perek of Meseches Kiddushin is Perek Ha'isha Niknas. The second perek of Maseches Kiddushin is [[Perek Ha'Ish Mekadesh]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Dafim/41a]

* Kiddushin 41a: Kiddushin 41a is an amud from [[Maseches Kiddushin]], and is the first amud of [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]]. It contains the sugya [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].


* The Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a: The mishnah on Kiddushin 41a, printed below, has [[three dinim]].
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו

Three dinim: The Mishnah on 41a has a [[first din]], a [[second din]], and a [[third din]].

First din:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
This is the first din of the Mishna. You can read about the [[words of the first din]], a [[literal translation of the first din]], and a [[pshat in the first din]]. The first din is the subject of the perek's first sugya, [[hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya]].

Words of the first din: The first din includes [[the word ha'ish]], [[the word mekadesh]], [[the word bo]], and [[the word u'b'shlucho]].

The word ha'ish: The word ha'ish (האיש) is composed of [[the word ish]] and [[the prefix hay]].

The word ish:

The prefix hay:

The word mekadesh: "Mekadesh" (מקדש) is the [[Hebrew masculine singular participial]] of [[the shoresh קדש]].

The word bo:

The word u'b'shlucho:

Literal translation of the first din: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal translation might be:
> The man is being mekadesh, with himself or with an emissary
Try to figure out what this means in context. You might ask: [[What does "being mekadesh" mean here?]] [[Why does ha'ish have a hay ha'yedia?]]

What does "being mekadesh" mean here? We find here a klal of mishnayos that a "present tense" statement means a psak, and so "the man is being mekadesh himself or with an emissary" in this context means "the man is _allowed_ to be mekadesh, himself or with an emissary."

Why does ha'ish have a hay ha'yedia? [[It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a hay ha'yedia]], but [[perhaps the Mishnah uses the hay ha'yedia because of the Mishnah it is following]].

It seems as if the Mishnah should not be using a hay ha'yedia: If the Mishnah wanted to say "any man can be mekadesh an isha using these methods," why did it say "_the_ man can be mekadesh", as if only some specific man can do it, instead of saying "_a_ man can be mekadesh," ie any man? (Then it would read: איש מקדש, instead of האיש מקדש, because [[Hebrew nouns]] [[by default have an indefinite article]].)

Perhaps the Mishnah uses the hay ha'yedia because of the Mishnah it is following: Perhaps we can say that this Mishnah is following the first Mishnah of the masechta, which spoke about ways "the woman" is niknas, and so maybe the "the" in "the woman" and the "the" in "the man" are being used to exclude one another - "_the_ woman" (as opposed to the man in the interaction,) and "_the_ man" (as opposed to the woman in the interaction.)

Pshat in the first din: A pshat in the first din of the Mishna might be:
> A man is allowed to be mekadesh an isha, himself or with a shaliach

Second din: The second din reads:
> האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה


Third din: The third din reads:
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Perakim/Ha'ish Mekadesh]

* Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh: The sugyos of Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh can be accessed [[by Mishnah]], or [[by daf]]. (Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh is the second perek of [[Maseches Kiddushin]].)

By daf: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh covers eighteen dafim, beginning on [[Kiddushin 41a]] and ending on Kiddushin 58b.

By Mishnah: Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh begins with [[the Mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]].


[Talmud Bavli/Kiddushin/Sugyos]

* Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya: _Hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ is the first sugya in [[Perek Ha'ish Mekadesh]] appearing on [[Kiddushin 41a]]. It discusses the [[first din]] of [[the mishnah on Kiddushin 41a]]. You can read the sugya's full text below, and learn the sugya's various [[parts]], and can review with an outside [[summary]].
< גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא
< איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
< כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
< אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
< עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
< ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
< כמוך וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
< בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
< מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
< מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
< איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
< למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו

Parts: The sugya of _hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ begins with an [[opening kasha]], followed by [[two lishnas of the Gemara's terutz]].

Opening kasha: The sugya of _hashta b'shlucho mekadesh bo meboya_ begins with a opening kasha, quoted below. You can read about the [[words of the opening kasha]], a [[literal translation of the opening kasha]], a [[pshat in the opening kasha]], and hear [[ha'aras on the opening kasha]].
< [גמ'] השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא [אמר]

Words of the opening kasha:
The text of the opening kasha is composed of the word [["hashta"]], [[the word "b'shlucho"]], [[the word "mekadesh"]], [[the word "bo"]], and [[the word "meboya"]].

The word "b'shlucho":

The word "mekadesh":

The word "bo":

The word "meboya":

Literal translation of the opening kasha: Once we have identified which meanings to assign to the individual words, a literal (but unclear) translation of the opening kasha would be:
> "Now that with his agent he is mekadesh, with himself is needed."
Try to figure out what this might mean, then you can ask the following questions: [[What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here?]] [[What does 'with himself' mean here?]] [[What does "is needed" mean here?]]

What does 'with his agent he is mekadesh' mean here? You might wonder what the words "with his agent he is mekadesh" (בשלוחו מקדש) mean. They are a reference to the Mishnah, which said that a man can be mekadesh with his agent.

What does 'with himself' mean here? You might ask what does the word "with himself" (בו) means in the sentence "with himself is needed". "With himself" is a quotation from the Mishnah, and so the subject of the sentence is the word "בו", and the literal translation of the Gemara is that it is saying "the word בו in the Mishnah is needed".

What does "is needed" mean here? The Gemara uses the phrase "is needed" (מיבעיא), from [[the shoresh בעה]], to speak about words in the Mishnah and to speak about why each one is necessary.

Pshat in the opening kasha: The opening kasha seems to be asking: now that the Mishnah has taught us that a man can be mekadesh via his agent, then I already know by implication that the lesser chiddush that he can be mekadesh himself is true, so why did the Mishnah have to teach it to me?

Ha'aras on the opening kasha: From the opening kasha, we see certain assumptions the Gemara is making about the Mishnah.

Two lishnas of the Gemara's terutz: After the opening kasha, the Gemara gives a [[first lishna]], and a [[second lishna]]. ([["Lishna"|What is a "lishna"?]])

First lishna: The first lishna is an answer to the Gemara's kasha, quoted below. The first lishna is composed of the [[amira of R Yosef]] and [[ha d'Rav Safra]].
< [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו כי הא דרב
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא

Amira of R Yosef: The amira of R Yosef follows the Gemara's kasha and is the first portion of the first lishna, quoted below.
< [גמ' השתא בשלוחו מקדש בו מיבעיא] אמר
< רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו [כי הא דרב]

Ha d'Rav Safra: The section "ha d'Rav Safra" follows the amira of R Yosef, quoted below. You can read about the [[words of ha d'Rav Safra]]
< כי הא דרב [רב יוסף מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו]
< ספרא מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא

Words of ha d'Rav Safra: The section "ha d'Rav Safra" includes the word ki, the word ha, the phrase d'Rav Safra, the word machrich, the word reisha, the word Rava, the word malach, and the word shibuta.

Second lishna: The second lishna goes from the phrase "ika d'amri" until the two dots that end the sugya, quoted below.
< איכא דאמרי בהא איסורא נמי אית בה
< כדרב יהודה אמר רב דאמר רב יהודה
< אמר רב אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה
< עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה
< ותתגנה עליו ורחמנא אמר ואהבת לרעך
< כמוך וכי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה השתא
< בשלוחה מיקדשא בה מיבעיא אמר רב יוסף
< מצוה בה יותר מבשלוחה כי הא דרב ספרא
< מחריך רישא רבא מלח שיבוטא אבל בהא
< איסורא לית בה כדר״ל דאמר ר״ל טב
< למיתב טן דו מלמיתב ארמלו
